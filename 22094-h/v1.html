<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> sentiment of Antiquity&mdash;that "The life of no man is
pleasing to the gods which is not useful to his fellows,"&mdash;has
been my guiding principle of action during the last
twelve years of my life. To live for my own simple and
sole gratification, to have no other object in view but my
own personal profit and renown, would be to me an intolerable
existence. To be useful, or to attempt to be
useful, in my day and generation, was the predominant
motive which led me into The Desert, and sustained me
there, alone and unprotected, during a long and perilous
journey.</p>

<p>But, in presenting this work to the British public, I
have to state, that it is only <i>supplementary</i> and <i>fragmentary</i>.
If, therefore, any one were to judge of the results of
my Saharan Tour merely by what is here given, he would
do me a great injustice. I had expected, by this time,
that certain Reports on the Commerce and Geography of
The Great Desert, as well as a large Map of the Routes of
this part of Africa, would have been given to the public.
It is not my fault that their publication is still delayed.
I can only regret it, because what I am now publishing
comes <i>first</i>, instead of <i>last</i>, and consequently deranges<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-xii" id="V1-xii"></a>[<a href="./images/1-xii.png">xii</a>]</span>
my plan, the following pages being, indeed, <i>supplementary</i>
to the Reports and Map. I come, therefore, before
the public with no small disadvantage.</p>

<p>With regard to these supplementary and fragmentary
extracts from my journal, I have also to state, they consist
only of about two-thirds of the journal. For the
present, I deemed it prudent to suppress the rest. But
this likewise may disturb the harmony and mar the completeness
of the work. However, if these portions of the
journal are favourably received, other extracts may yet
be published.</p>

<p>On entering The Desert, my principal object was to
ascertain how and to what extent the Saharan Slave-Trade
was carried on; although but a comparatively
small portion of the following pages is devoted to this
subject. I have already reported fully on this traffic,
and it was unnecessary to go over the ground again,
which might defeat, by disagreeable repetitions and endless
details, the object which I have in view,&mdash;that of
exciting an abhorrence of the Slave-Trade in the hearts
of my fellow countrymen and countrywomen.</p>

<p>In these published extracts from my journal, I have
endeavoured to give a truthful and faithful picture of
the Saharan Tribes; their ideas, thoughts, words, and
actions; and, where convenient, I have allowed them to
speak and act for themselves. This is the main object
which I have undertaken to accomplish in this Narrative
of my Personal Adventures in The Sahara. The public
must, and will, I doubt not, judge how far I have suc<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-xiii" id="V1-xiii"></a>[<a href="./images/1-xiii.png">xiii</a>]</span>ceeded,
and award me praise or blame, as may be my
desert. If I have failed, I shall not abandon myself to
despair, but shall console myself with the thought that I
have done the best I was able to do under actual circumstances,
and in my then state of health. It would,
indeed, ill become me to shrink from public criticism,
after having braved the terrors and hardships of The
Desert. However, the publication of this journal may
induce others to penetrate The Desert,&mdash;persons better
qualified, and more ably and perfectly equipped than
myself, and who may so accomplish something more permanently
advantageous than what I have been able to
compass. Acting, then, as pioneer to others, my Saharan
labours will not be fruitless.</p>

<p>But, if any persons obstinately object to the style and
matters of my Narrative of Desert Travel, I shall likewise
as obstinately endeavour to hold my ground. To
all such I say,&mdash;"Go to now, ye objectors and gainsayers,
and do better." My mission was <i>motu proprio</i>,
and I plunged in The Desert without your permission.
But I am but one of the two hundred millions of Europe.
You can surely get volunteers. You have the money,
the rank, the patronage, and the learned and philanthropic
Societies of Europe at your back. Send others;
inspire them yourselves, and they may produce something
which you like better than what I have given you.
If I am not orthodox enough,&mdash;if I have not reviled the
Deism of The Desert sufficiently to your taste,&mdash;send
those who will. A little less zeal in Exeter Hall, and a<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-xiv" id="V1-xiv"></a>[<a href="./images/1-xiv.png">xiv</a>]</span>
little more in The Desert, would do neither you nor the
world any harm. A little less clamour about Church
orthodoxy, or any other doxy<a name="FNa_1-1" id="FNa_1-1"></a><a href="#FoN_1-1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>, and a little more anxiety
for the welfare of all mankind, would infinitely more become
you, as Englishmen and Christians, and be more in
harmony with that divine injunction, which sent out the
first teachers of Christianity amongst the Greeks and
Barbarians, in The City and The Desert, to preach the
Gospel to every creature under heaven. If I be too
much of an abolitionist, send one who admires slavery,
and who will write up the Slave-Trade of The Desert. I
have written in my way: you write in your way. If my
pages disclose no discoveries in science, this I can only
lament. When a man has no science in him, or no
education in science, he can give you none. But what
are your European Societies of Science for? Are they
play-things, or are they serious affairs? Have you neither
money nor zeal to equip a scientific expedition to
The Desert? If not, I cannot help you. By the way, I
was astonished to receive, since my return, a note from
one of your eminent geologists, repudiating and protesting
against all knowledge of the subject of "The Geology of
The Desert." And The Desert is a fifth part of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-xv" id="V1-xv"></a>[<a href="./images/1-xv.png">xv</a>]</span>
African Continent! Yet this gentleman dogmatizes and
theorizes on all geological formations, and can tell the whole
history of the geology of our planet, from the first moment
when it was bowled by the hand of The Omnipotent
in the immensity of space, of suns and systems! If such
presumption and self-willed ignorance discover themselves
in great men, what are we to expect of little men?</p>

<p>In the following pages, I have encroached upon my
Reports, to describe several of the Oases of The Desert,
besides giving as much of the routes as was necessary
to render the Narrative of my journey intelligible.
But this is all I could conscientiously do. For the rest
of the geographical information, the public must wait.</p>

<p>I return for a moment to the traffic in slaves. Born
with an innate hatred of oppression, whatever form, or
shape, or name it may take, and under what modes
soever it may be developed, mentally or bodily, in chaining
men down under a political despotism, or in forging for
them a creed and forcing it on their consciences,&mdash;I have,
since I could exercise the power of reflection, always looked
upon the traffic in human flesh and blood as the most
gigantic system of wickedness the world ever saw; and
which I most deplore, in this our late, more humane and
enlightened age, stands forth and raises its horrid head,
impiously defying Heaven! In very truth, it is a system
of crime, which dares</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Defy the Omnipotent to arms!"</span>
</div></div>

<p>The reader must, therefore, excuse the language with
which I have execrated this traffic in the pages of my<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-xvi" id="V1-xvi"></a>[<a href="./images/1-xvi.png">xvi</a>]</span>
Journal. There may be some men who think it no crime
to buy and sell their fellow-men; I have seen many such
amongst the Moslems. But he who thinks the traffic in
slaves to be a crime against the human race, has a right
to denounce it accordingly. I must therefore make a few
preliminary observations, though painful to my feelings.</p>

<p>It is notorious that the agitations of the Anti-Corn-Law
League have given very lately a powerful impulse to
the Slave-Trade, and slaves have risen in Cuba to 30 and
50 per cent. above their previous average value, since
<i>slave</i> sugar has been admitted upon the same terms, or
nearly so, as <i>free-labour</i> sugar, into England. This is
entirely the work of The League. Some of these gentlemen
think we must have cheap sugar at any risk, at
any cost, even if wetted with the blood of the slaves. A
ridiculous incident occurs to me. I once saw a child
frightened into a dislike for white loaf sugar, by holding
up a piece to the candle, and pretending it dropped
blood. But there is no delusion or metaphor here, for
the sugars of slave-plantations are really obtained by
the blood-whippings and scourgings of the victimized
slaves!</p>

<p>As to Cobden, his Cobdenites, and Satellites, they
would sell their own souls, and the whole human race into
bondage, to have a free trade in slaves and sugar. This
new generation of impostors&mdash;who teach that all virtue
and happiness consist in buying in the cheapest, and
selling in the dearest markets&mdash;are now dogging at the
heels of Government, in combination with the West India<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-xvii" id="V1-xvii"></a>[<a href="./images/1-xvii.png">xvii</a>]</span>
agents, to get them to re-establish a species of mitigated
Slave-Trade, because, forsooth, there should be
right and liberty to buy and sell a man, as there is right
and liberty to buy and sell a beast.</p>

<p>I am not an enemy to Free Trade. I have duly
noticed and praised the free-trade mart of Ghat, and
shown how it prospers in comparison with the restricted
system of the Turks, prevalent at Mourzuk. But this I
do say, the case of Slavery was an exceptional case, as
the Ten Hours' Factory Bill was an exceptional case in
the regulation and restriction of labour. I fear, however,
there are some of the Leaguers so outrageous in
their advocacy of abstract principles, that they would
have a free-trade in vice&mdash;a free-trade in consigning
people to perdition! They are of the calibre of the
men who wielded that dread engine of the "Reign of
Terror," the "Committee of Public Safety," and made
it death to speak a word against the "One Indivisible
Republic<a name="FNa_1-2" id="FNa_1-2"></a><a href="#FoN_1-2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>." These Leaguers are bent upon establishing
an equal, although differently-formed, tyranny amongst
us, and we cannot too soon and too energetically resist
their odious and intolerable pretensions.</p>

<p>But I know not, whether these civil tyrants be so bad
as the spiritual tyrants who have just set up for themselves
what they call a "Free Kirk." These reverend
gentlemen have received the fruits of the blood of
the slaves, employed on the laborious fields of the
Southern States of America, to build up their new Free<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-xviii" id="V1-xviii"></a>[<a href="./images/1-xviii.png">xviii</a>]</span>
Church, pretending they have a Divine right to receive
the value of the forced-labour of slaves, and quoting
Scripture like the Devil himself. When called upon to
refund they refuse, and make the contributions of the
Presbyterian slave-dealers of the United States a sort
of corner-stone of their Free Kirk. Why these priests
of religion out-O'Connell-O'Connell, who point-blank
refused, for the support of his sham Repeal, and sent
back contemptuously, the dollars spotted and tainted
with the blood of the slaves!&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It
is the old story, the old trick of our good friends, the
Scottish divines, and their old leaven of Scottish fanaticism.
We know them of ancient date. We have read
a line of Milton, who in his time so admirably resisted
their bigotry. It is immortal like all that our divine
bard wrote. Here is the line&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"New Presbyter is but old Priest writ large."</span>
</div></div>

<p>The Free Kirk has cut its connexion with the State,
because it says the State wishes to enslave its ministers.
Yet it has no objection to receive monies from the slave-holders
in America. The Free Kirk will build up its
boasted freedom on the wasting blood and bones of the
unhappy children of Africa! Why, indeed, should these
Scottish divines, headed by the Presbyters Candlish and
Cunningham, seek or advocate the freedom of the slaves
held by their fellow Presbyters of the United States?
Is it not enough that they seek and maintain their own
freedom, and at whatsoever cost? Have they not<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-xix" id="V1-xix"></a>[<a href="./images/1-xix.png">xix</a>]</span>
received the pro-slavery mantle of the late venerated Dr.
Chalmers, and can they, poor pigmies, possibly shake it
off? Would it not be impious to do so? No, they cannot,&mdash;dare
not do this. For, as it was said by Lord
George Bentinck, of a quondam champion of the people,
in the last Session of Parliament, "Liberty is on their
tongues, but despotism is in their hearts."</p>

<p>What can be more humiliating to a generous and
tolerant mind, than to see a body of Christian ministers
struggling to obtain by a Parliamentary enactment, the
cession of plots of land for building of churches for the
worship of God in liberty and truth, from the tyrannical
holders of the soil; and, at the same time, this very body
of priests does not scruple to receive the money of American
slave-holders, to build and endow these self-same
churches? Such incredible inconsistency makes one sick
at heart, and inclined to question the existence of Christian
feelings in the professors and teachers of Christianity!</p>

<p>It is deeply to be deplored that our Anti-Slavery Society
confines itself so much to protests, and what it calls
"the moral principle." No people of the world has
done more for the liberties of Africa than the Society of
Friends in England, and no people more admirably exemplify
in their conduct the humane and pacific morals
of Christianity. But when the Founder of our religion
resisted his enemies by the remonstrance, "Why strikest
thou me?" something more was meant than a protest.
We have had lately a <i>triste</i> example of the end of protests
in a neighbouring country. The annual protest of<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-xx" id="V1-xx"></a>[<a href="./images/1-xx.png">xx</a>]</span>
the French Chamber of Deputies against the extinction
of the nationality of Poland, not only ended in barren
results, and excited public ridicule, but actually terminated
in the triumph of the nefarious scheme against
which it was made. Never was a country so humiliated
as France in this case!&mdash;Its Chief, the Sovereign of its
choice, consenting at the time, to the damning act of the
extinction of Polish nationality, for the sake of accomplishing
a low and scandalous family intrigue in Spain!
This was something more than ridiculous, and is one of
the many infamies of our age, perpetrated on so large a
scale. Now, I do not assert, that the protests of the
Anti-Slavery Society will end in the re-enactment of the
Slave-Trade by the British Parliament. But the last and
present Sessions of Imperial Parliament, show symptoms
of our country abandoning Africa, after the labours
of half a century, to all the horrors of the Slave-Trade.
Mr. P. Borthwick and Mr. Hume, more especially the latter,
pleaded, in conjunction with others, during last Session, for
the withdrawal of the British cruisers from off the Western
Coast of Africa, and free trade in emigration, if not in
slaves. In this good work, of course, they have the
sympathies of the Anti-Slavery Free Trading League.
Some of our journals opine, in their late articles, that a
change has come over the spirit of our abolition dream, and
suggest that the clerk, in charge of the Anti-Slavery Papers
at the Foreign Office, is an old antiquated, superannuated
being. In a word, these journals and Mr. Hume's pro-slavery
clique, see no reason why Great Britain should<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-xxi" id="V1-xxi"></a>[<a href="./images/1-xxi.png">xxi</a>]</span>
not exhibit to this and succeeding ages, the most dreadful
bad faith in the case of British abolition. They
would have us say to the world:&mdash;"All our Anti-Slavery
efforts, our Parliamentary enactments against Slavery,
our huge blue books of published Anti-Slavery papers,
our protocols and treaties with Foreign Powers, all, each,
and singular, are one grand organized system of selfishness
and hypocrisy." I know very well that, in general,
foreigners give us no credit whatever for our anti-slavery
feelings and public acts for the suppression of the Slave-Trade.
This they have reiterated in my ears. And,
how can they give us credit for sincerity in abolition,
when our public men and public writers call for something
like the re-enactment of the British Slave-Trade?&mdash;and,
whilst our quondam champions of Free Churches
receive the blood-stained money of slave-labour to build
up their new ecclesiastical establishments? Mankind
reason from actions, and not from verbal or written declarations.
Our Act of Abolition, and the famous twenty
millions, are not such wonderful things after all, when
we owed a hundred millions to the descendants of our
slaves. We were also nearly half a century in abolishing
the traffic, after it had been denounced as robbery
and murder by our highest and greatest statesmen, Pitt
and Fox<a name="FNa_1-3" id="FNa_1-3"></a><a href="#FoN_1-3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>. This slowness of our work has given the<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-xxii" id="V1-xxii"></a>[<a href="./images/1-xxii.png">xxii</a>]</span>
cue to the suspicions of our national enemies; and, certainly,
to use a gross vulgarism, has "taken out the
shine," or very much dimmed the lustre of this great act
of justice to the African race.</p>

<p>Here I cannot restrain myself from giving a word of
caution to the working-classes of our country, to those
more especially who head the new "National Society,"
and form other and similar leagues. You say the politicians
of the Anti-Corn Law League are your men; you
adore your Humes, and Duncombes, and Wakleys. You,
English democrats, or reformers, as you may call yourselves,
admire the self-government and cheap government
of the Transatlantic Model Republic. You do well. But
now read some of their latest handiworks, without note
or comment on my part. The violent impulse given to
the Slave-Trade in Cuba and the Brazils&mdash;the advocacy
of a free trade in Slaves by the Leaguers in and out
the British Parliament&mdash;the invasion and subjugation of
Mexico, on the joint principles of lust of conquest and
the extension of Slavery. Deny these facts if you can.
Learn, then, to think, there may be democracy and
republicanism without liberty or freedom.</p>

<p>I pray God, that the protests and public appeals and
remonstrances to Government of the Anti-Slavery Society
may not end in barren results. But if the Leaguers
and Democrats have their own way, its voice, though
just and righteous, will be at length reduced to a faint
cry, a last shriek of despair&mdash;overwhelmed by the loud
laughs and jeers of the fiends, which possess the dealers<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-xxiii" id="V1-xxiii"></a>[<a href="./images/1-xxiii.png">xxiii</a>]</span>
in human flesh and blood, and surround unhappy and
doomed Africa with a cordon of rapine and murder, of
blood and flames!</p>

<p>If I were asked, "What can be done for Africa?" I
should reply with no new thing, no nostrums of my own
concocting, but what has been reiterated again and again.
Teach her children to till the soil&mdash;to cultivate available
exports by which they may obtain in exchange,
through the medium of a legitimate commerce, the
European products and manufactures necessary for their
use and enjoyment. Until this be done, nothing effectual
will be done. In vain you send missionaries of
religion, or agents of abolition; in vain you contract
treaties with the Princes of Africa. It is humiliating
to think, equally a disgrace to our religion as to our
civilization, that our connexion with Africa has only
served to plunge her into deeper misery and profounder
degradation. With truth we here may apply the strong
censure of a Chinese Emperor, "That the march of
Christians is whitened with human bones." Wherever
we have touched her western shores there our footsteps
have been marked with blood and devastation. We
have fostered and encouraged within the heart of Africa
the most odious and unnatural passions. We have<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-xxiv" id="V1-xxiv"></a>[<a href="./images/1-xxiv.png">xxiv</a>]</span>
stimulated the prince to sell his subjects, the father to
sell his child, the brother to sell the sister, the husband
the wife, into thrice-accursed and again accursed slavery!
We have done all and more than this, whilst we have
convulsed every state and kingdom of Africa with war,
for the supply of cargoes of human beings. And for
what? To cultivate our miserable cotton and sugar
plantations! These are the doctrines of mercy and
charity which we have taught the poor untutored
children of Africa. Happy for poor forlorn, dusky,
naked Africa, had she never seen the pale visage or met
the Satanic brow of the European Christian! Does any
man in his senses, who believes in God and Providence,
think that the wrongs of Africa will go on for ever
unavenged? Already, has not Providence avenged the
wrongs of Africa upon Spain and Portugal, by reducing
their national character and consideration to the lowest
in the European family of nations? And as to the
United States of America, has not the boasted liberty of
our Republican countrymen, who colonized America,
become a by-word, a hissing, and a scorn, amongst the
nations of the earth? Have not these slave-holding
Americans committed acts, nationally, within the last
few years, which the most absolute Governments of
Europe would blush to be guilty of? And what is one
of their last acts, on a smaller scale, but not less decisively
indicative of their national morality? The New York
Bible Society has declared that it will not give the
Bible to slaves, even when they are able to read the<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-xxv" id="V1-xxv"></a>[<a href="./images/1-xxv.png">xxv</a>]</span>
Bible! Would the Czar of Russia permit such an
impious rule as this to be made by his nobles for their
slaves or serfs? Such an action would render the liberties
of a thousand republics a mockery, a snare, and a
delusion, and their names infamous throughout the world.</p>

<p>And the time of us Englishmen will come next&mdash;our
day of infamy! unless we show ourselves worthy
that transcendant position in which Providence has
placed us, at the pinnacle of the empires of Earth, as
the leaders and champions of universal freedom.</p>

<p>In noticing the efforts made for raising Africa from
her immemorial degradation, we are bound to confess
our obligations to the Mahometans for what they have
done. If they have extirpated Christianity from the
soil of North Africa, and planted, instead of this tree
of fair and pure fruit, the more glaring and showy plant
of Islamism, they have, at the same time, endeavoured
to raise Africa to their own level of demi-civilization.
Whilst we condemn their slave-traffic as we condemn our
own, we must do justice to the efforts which they have
made, by the spread of their creed and the diffusion
of their commerce, during a series of ten or twelve centuries,
for promoting the civilization of Africa. They
have succeeded, they have done infinitely more for
Africa than we ourselves. They have organized and
established regular governments through all Central
Africa, and inculcated a taste for the occupation and
the principles of commerce. A great portion of this
internal trade is untainted by slavery. Bornou, Soudan,<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-xxvi" id="V1-xxvi"></a>[<a href="./images/1-xxvi.png">xxvi</a>]</span>
Timbuctoo, and Jinnee, exhibit to us groups of immense
and populous cities, all regularly governed and trading
with one another. They have abolished human sacrifice,
which lingers in our East India possessions to this
day. They have regulated marriage and restrained
polygamy. They have made honour and reverence to
be paid to grey hairs, superseding the diabolical custom
of exposing or destroying the aged. They have introduced
a knowledge of reading and writing. The oases
of Ghat and Ghadames furnish more children, in proportion,
who can read and write, than any of our
English towns. The Koran is transcribed in beautiful
characters by Negro Talebs on the banks of the Niger.
The Moors have likewise introduced many common
useful trades into Central Africa. But above all, the
Mohammedans have introduced the knowledge of the
one true God! and destroyed the fetisch idols. Let us
then take care how we arrogate to ourselves the right
and fact of civilizing the world. Nay, there cannot be
a question, if we would abandon Africa to the Mohammedans,
and leave off our man-stealing trade and practices
on the Western Coast, the dusky children of the
torrid zones would gradually advance in civilization.
But is not the bare idea of such an alternative an
indelible disgrace to Christendom?</p>

<p>Mr. Cooley, in his learned work, entitled "The Negroland
of the Arabs<a name="FNa_1-4" id="FNa_1-4"></a><a href="#FoN_1-4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>," seems to doubt if the Slave-Trade<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-xxvii" id="V1-xxvii"></a>[<a href="./images/1-xxvii.png">xxvii</a>]</span>
can be abolished or civilization advanced, in Central
Africa, because of the neighbourhood of The Desert.
This, however, is transferring the guilt of slavery and of
voluntary barbarism, if barbarism can be crime, from
the volition of responsible man to a great natural fact,
or circumstance of creation&mdash;The Desert; and is a style
of observation perfectly indefensible, as well as contrary
to philosophy and facts. First, we cannot limit the
stretch or progress of the Negro mind any more than that
of the European intellect. Mr. Cooley himself admits
that the Nigritian people have advanced in civilization.
And if they have advanced, why not continue to advance?
But so far contrary are facts to Mr. Cooley's theory, that
The Desert, instead of being an obstacle to civilization,
is favourable to it, whilst the Nigritian countries beyond
the influence of The Desert are plunged into deeper
barbarism. The reader will only have to compare my
account of the Touaricks, with the recently published
account of the social state of the kingdom of Dahomy,<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-xxviii" id="V1-xxviii"></a>[<a href="./images/1-xxviii.png">xxviii</a>]</span>
to convince himself how completely fallacious in application
is Mr. Cooley's theory<a name="FNa_1-5" id="FNa_1-5"></a><a href="#FoN_1-5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>. Slaves, too, abound in
thickly populated countries as well as desert countries:
witness China and India. The Sahara, also, has its
paradisical spots, or oases of enjoyment, as well as its
wastes and hardships. It is likewise, not true, that the
Saharan tribes depend for their happiness on the possession
of slaves, or that life in The Desert is galling and
insupportable. Many a happy oasis is without a slave.
However this may be, it is always an extremely dangerous
line of argument, to represent moral depravity as
springing necessarily from certain physical and unalterable
circumstances of creation. Finally, to represent The
Great Desert as the buttress of the Slave-Trade, is
contrary to all our experience. In deserts and mountains
we find always the free-men: in soft and luxurious
countries we find the slaves. It is not the free-born
Touarick who is the slave-dealer, or the stimulator of
the slave-traffic, but the Moorish merchant, and the
voluptuary on the coast who sends him. All that
the Saharan tribes do, is to escort the merchants
over The Desert; and they would still escort them
over The Desert did they not deal in slaves, carrying on
only legitimate commerce.</p>

<p>I may conclude by a word on Discoveries in The
Sahara. It is now twenty years or more since The Sahara
was explored, or before my present hap-hazard tour.
From what I have seen since my return, and the little<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-xxix" id="V1-xxix"></a>[<a href="./images/1-xxix.png">xxix</a>]</span>
encouragement given to this sort of enterprise,&mdash;the
public of Great Britain being so much occupied with
railways, free-trade, and currency questions, educational
schemes, and State endowed, or voluntary ecclesiastical
establishments,&mdash;it is difficult to foresee how and when
another tour may be undertaken, or how a tourist will
have the heart to make another experiment. Unhappily,
the spirit of discovery, like Virtue's self, is difficult to be
satisfied with its own reward. Something, however, may
in time be expected from the French, who will get
restless in their Algerian limits, and make a bold effort
to disenthral themselves, by leaping the bounds of the
mysterious Sahara. Evidently the French Government
have prohibited all isolated attempts. But should their
colony succeed, and they must make it succeed, then a
grand stroke of policy and action will be struck upon the
lines of the Saharan routes, for diverting The Desert
trade, if possible, into Algerian channels. We must wait
patiently this time for further researches. Necessity
propels nations in the march of discovery. England has
some considerable stake likewise in the commerce of The
Great Desert. But our governmental affairs are so vast,
and ramify over so large a space of the world, that it is
extremely difficult to get a Minister to strike out a new
path, unless he has the sympathies and hearty support
of the public with him. And certainly the last thing in
the imagination of the British public is the undertaking
Discoveries in The Great Desert.</p>

<p>A remark may be made respecting the English spel<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-xxx" id="V1-xxx"></a>[<a href="./images/1-xxx.png">xxx</a>]</span>ling
of Arabic words and names. I have not adopted
the new system, as very few people understand it. I
have endeavoured to represent the sounds of the original
words in the ordinary way, giving sometimes the Arabic
letters for those who prefer greater correctness. The
spelling of Oriental and African names is also occasionally
varied for the sake of variety, and sometimes I
have written the words in various ways, according to the
style of pronunciation amongst different Saharan tribes.
I have also omitted accents and italics as much as possible,
to avoid confusion and trouble to the printer.
With respect to the contents at the head of the chapters,
numberless little things and circumstances are besides
unavoidably omitted in the enumeration.</p>

<p>I have few acknowledgments to make to those who
rendered me assistance in the prosecution of my Saharan
tour and researches. I have rather complaints to prefer
against professed friends. I was unable to get up in
The Desert a single thing, the most trifling, to aid me in
my observations, when I had determined to penetrate
farther into the interior; whilst, somehow or other, a
Memorandum was obtained from the Porte to recal me
instead of a Firman to help me on my way. Fortunately
I was beyond its power when it arrived at Tripoli, from
Constantinople. But if I feel the bitterness of this want
of sympathy, and these acts of hostility, I have the
pleasure of being triumphant over all the obstacles
thrown in my way. I felt freer in The Desert, unloaded
by obligations. Indeed, the fewer of these a traveller<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-xxxi" id="V1-xxxi"></a>[<a href="./images/1-xxxi.png">xxxi</a>]</span>
has, the better. He always supports his trials and
privations with lighter spirits and a more cheerful
heart. His success is his own, if his failure is his own
also. Nevertheless I have not forgotten, nor can I ever
forget, to the latest day of my life, the acts of kindness
shown to me by the rude and simple-minded people of
The Desert, and I have duly and most scrupulously
chronicled them all.</p>

great mystery of an honest and thinking mind. The
reading accidentally of a fugitive <i>brochure</i>, thrown upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-2" id="V1-2"></a>[<a href="./images/1-2.png">2</a>]</span>
the table of the public library of Algiers, gave me the
germ of the idea, which, fructifying and expanding,
ultimately led me to the design of visiting and exploring
the celebrated Oasis of Ghadames, planted far-away
amidst the most appalling desolations of the Great
Saharan Wilderness. This should teach us to lower our
pretensions, and take a large discount from our merits in
originating our various enterprises; but, alas! our over-weening
self-love always manages to get the better of us.
The <i>brochure</i> alluded to was a number of the <i>Revue de
L'Orient</i>, published at Paris, containing a notice of
Ghadames by M. Subtil, the notorious sulphur<a name="FNa_1-6" id="FNa_1-6"></a><a href="#FoN_1-6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>-explorer
and adventurer of Tripoli.</p>

<p>On leaving Algiers, in January, 1845, I carried the
idea of Ghadames with me to Tunis; and thence, after
agitating an exploration to The Desert amongst my
friends, some of whom plainly told me, if I went I should
never return, I should be consumed with the sun and
fever, or murdered by the natives, and to attempt such
a thing was altogether madness, I journeyed on to
Tripoli, where I entered with all my soul and might into
the undertaking. But as in Tunis so in Tripoli, I heard
the birds of evil-omen uttering the same mournful notes
of discouragement:&mdash;"I should never reach Ghadames,
no one else had done so, or no one else had gone and
returned. I should perish by the hand of banditti, or
sink under the burning heat. I was not the man; it<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-3" id="V1-3"></a>[<a href="./images/1-3.png">3</a>]</span>
required a frame of iron. Enthusiasm was very well in
its way, but it required a man who was expert in arms,
and who could fight his way through The Desert." And
such is the absurd character of men, and some people
pretending to be friends of African discovery, that, on
hearing of my safe return after nine months' absence,
they felt chagrined their sagacious vaticinations were not
verified. Like a man who writes a book, and ever so
bad a book, he cannot afterwards adopt a right sentiment,
or course of action, because he has written his
book. It is true, the fate of Davidson, in Western Barbary,
and the late disastrous mishap of the young Tuscan
on his return from Mourzuk, favoured the pretensions of
these Barbary-coast prophets, who cannot comprehend a
deviation from what had happened before, but it is
equally true that the violent deaths of these individuals,
so far as we can gather from the details, were brought
about by the greatest possible imprudence on their part.
However, I may say without hesitation, no people dread
The Desert so much, and have in them so little of
the spirit of enterprise and African discovery, as the
naturalized Europeans of Tunis and Tripoli, and other
parts of Barbary. To purchase the co-operation of a
volunteer in these countries would require more money
than defraying the expense of an expedition, and after
all, from the love of intrigue and double-dealing which
Europeans long resident in Barbary acquire, as well
as other drawbacks, you would be very badly served.</p>

<p>I shall begin the narrative of my personal adventures
in The Sahara with my departure from the island of
Jerbah to Tripoli.</p>

<p><i>May 7th, 1845.</i>&mdash;Left Jerbah in the evening for<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-4" id="V1-4"></a>[<a href="./images/1-4.png">4</a>]</span>
Tripoli in the coaster <i>Mes&acirc;oud</i> ("happy"). The captain
and owner was a Maltese, but the colours under which
we sailed were Tunisian. Generally, a Moorish captain
<i>di bandeira</i> commands these coasters, because it saves
them dues at the various ports. Indeed, most of the
small coasting craft of Tunis and Tripoli, though the
property of Europeans, sail under the Turkish, rather
Mahometan (<i>red</i>) flag. Although May, our captain told
me, it was the worst month in the year for coasting in
Barbary. The wind comes in sudden puffs and gales,
blowing with extreme violence everything before it, prostrating
and rooting up the stoutest and strongest palm-trees.
So, in fact, as soon as we got out, a <i>gregale</i>
("north-easter") came on terrifically, and occasioned us
to return early next morning to Jerbah. During the
night, we were nearly swamped a few miles from the
shore. The <i>gregale</i> continued the next two days, striking
down several of the date-trees with great fury. When
these trees are so struck down, the people do not make
use of the wood for months, nay years, because it is ill-luck.
Jerbah is a grand focus of wind, and it sometimes
blows from every point of the compass in twelve hours.
&AElig;olus seems to patronize this isle; and, as at Mogador
on the Atlantic, wind here supplies the place of rain.
The inhabitants of Mogador have wind nine months
out of twelve; but seasons pass without a shower of
rain.</p>

<p><i>10th.</i>&mdash;Evening. Left again for Tripoli. We passed
the night about ten miles off the island, amongst the
fishing apparatus, which looks at a distance like so many
little islets. They consist of mere palm-tree boughs,
struck deep into the mud as piles are driven; and large<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-5" id="V1-5"></a>[<a href="./images/1-5.png">5</a>]</span>
spaces are thus enclosed. When the tide<a name="FNa_1-7" id="FNa_1-7"></a><a href="#FoN_1-7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> falls, the fish
get entangled or enclosed in these enclosures, and are
caught. Very fine fish are taken, and a fifth of the
ordinary sustenance of the islanders is derived from this
fishing. Unhappily the poor fishermen are obliged to
pay from twenty-five to fifty per cent. of the fish caught
to Government; so the poor in all countries are the
worse treated because they are poor.</p>

<p><i>11th.</i>&mdash;The wind becoming again foul, we put into a
little place called S&acirc;keeah, a port of the island in the
S.E. Here is nothing in the shape of a port town, only
a small square ruinous hovel of mud and plaster, and a
rude hut put up temporarily by a Maltese, who is building
a boat. I often think the Maltese are the <i>Irish</i> of
the South. Maltese enterprise is prevalent in all parts of
the Mediterranean but in their own country. The port,
such as it is, is defended by a little round battery, four
feet high, with three rusty pieces of cannon. If these
could be fired off, the masonry would tumble to pieces.
This is the <i>present</i> state of all the fortifications of
Mahometan Barbary. It frequently happens that when
a vessel of war visits the smaller Barbary ports, and
wishes to fire a salute in honour of the governors, it is
kindly requested this may not be done, because it is
necessary etiquette to return the salute, and, if returned,
the masonry of the fortifications may tumble down. The
scene was wild and bare; the colours of the landscape
light and bright. There were some Moors winnowing<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-6" id="V1-6"></a>[<a href="./images/1-6.png">6</a>]</span>
barley. An ox was treading out the corn, in Scripture
fashion. Crops of barley and other grain are grown all
over this fertile isle, under the date-palm and olive
trees. Small boats were waiting to carry off the grain
to Tunis. As in Ireland, little remains to feed the
people. They must feed on dates, or fish, or vegetables
and roots.</p>

<p><i>12th.</i>&mdash;Left S&acirc;keeah with a strong breeze. On looking
back on the island it had the appearance of thousands
of date-palms, boldly standing out of the sea, the land
being so low as not to be discernible a few miles' distance.
Jerbah, from this appearance, as from reality, deserves
the name of the "Isle of Palms." After crossing the
channel, which runs between the island and the continent,
whose waters were deep and rough, we got aground
in the Shallows, off Zarzees. This place is a round tower
(<i>burge</i>) on the continent, with a few houses and plantations
of olives and dates. Here commences the shoal-water,
or <i>bassa-fondo</i>, as our semi-Italian boatmen called
it, which continues east along the coast for eighty miles,
as far as Rais-el-Makhbes. When we got off again, at
the flow of the tide, we passed Biban ("two doors"),
the frontier place of the Tunisian dominions. Biban is
a castle, with some fifty Arab houses, built of palm-wood
and leaves in the shape of hay-stacks, and is situate on
an islet, on each side of which the sea passes inland and
forms a large lagoon. There is at Biban a single European
resident, an Italian, who acts as a French agent and
spy on the frontiers of Tunis and Tripoli. He is paid
about eighteen-pence a day, cheap enough for his high
political mission. The French are mighty fond of planting
spies all over Barbary; but espionage is their forte.<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-7" id="V1-7"></a>[<a href="./images/1-7.png">7</a>]</span>
In the evening we arrived at the <i>Salin&aelig;</i><a name="FNa_1-8" id="FNa_1-8"></a><a href="#FoN_1-8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>, "salt pits,"
on the coast, where we found several small coasters
loading with salt for Tripoli. Salt is also exported from
this place to Europe. Here we brought up for the night,
creeping and feeling our way as in the days of ancient
navigation. Our bringing up, however, was fortunate, for
the wind suddenly blew a gale from the N.W., continuing
all night, and until next day, when it fell a dead calm
again. Strange weather for the fine month of May.
But the Mediterranean, which is called the "<i>home</i>
station," is one of the nastiest chafing seas in the
world, and in this fair season of the year is exposed
to the most tremendous squalls, nay, continuous gales
of wind.</p>

<p><i>13th.</i>&mdash;We weighed again our little anchor, and in the
afternoon cast it before Rais-el-Makhbes, the last
anchoring ground of the <i>bassa-fondo</i>. The shore from
Zarzees to Rais-el-Makhbes is extremely low. The
<i>bassa-fondo</i> stretches off the coast in some places at
least thirty or forty miles, and is so shallow, that boats
of the smallest burden often ground. Here our Maltese
captain observed to me, with great mystery, "See, <i>Signore</i>,
we must now be very cautious how we act, and
watch the wind, so as to take it on the very first breath
of its being favourable, for from here it is all deep<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-8" id="V1-8"></a>[<a href="./images/1-8.png">8</a>]</span>
water to Tripoli." In general, however, the Maltese
captains display more courage than the Italians in these
coasters.</p>

<p><i>14th.</i>&mdash;In the morning we cleared Cape Makhbes. The
captain was to have rounded it and entered the little
port of Zouwarah, where there is a quarantine agent,
and landed me there according to agreement. I had
letters for this place, and was to have gone thence to
Tripoli by land, two or three days' journey. On remonstrating,
he gravely asked, "Whether I wished to do
him an injury, compelling him to go to Zouwarah, from
which port he couldn't get out for the wind?" Perceiving
the captain had fully made up his mind to break a written
agreement, signed before the Consul, for the temporary
advantage now offering, I left off remonstrating,
though extremely dissatisfied. We continued our course.
It soon fell calm, and, as usual, the calm was again succeeded
with a violent <i>gregale</i>, against which we could not
make head. I now told our Palinurus it was necessary
to look out for the port of Tripoli Vecchia, otherwise we
should be obliged to go back or keep the open sea all
night, for we could not reach Tripoli to-day. Half an
hour elapsed, and the wind continuing to freshen, the
captain took my advice. We turned direct south, and
sought the port. After experiencing some difficulty,
during which the captain, to my surprise, discovered the
most serious alarm, we found and entered the wished-for
haven. It was a real miracle of good luck, for the wind
came on dreadfully, the angry spray was covering us with
water, and our sufferings would have been beyond
description if we had been obliged to keep the sea. Our
bark was a mere cockle-shell, into which were rammed and<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-9" id="V1-9"></a>[<a href="./images/1-9.png">9</a>]</span>
jammed and crammed twenty-two mortal and immortal
beings: <i>C'est &agrave; dire</i>, four sailors, fourteen Moorish passengers,
including a woman and a child, two Jews, myself, and
a runaway slave. So that our heartfelt thankfulness to a
good Providence, pitying our folly and imprudence, may
be easily imagined. In the midst of our confusion while
searching for the port&mdash;having only three or four hours'
daylight before us&mdash;the most ludicrous scene was enacted,
which might have ended in the tragic. Some of the Moors
professed to know the port of Tripoli Vecchia. Hereupon
each fellow gave a different description, a thing
perfectly natural, as each would have seen the port
under different circumstances of time and place. "It was
surrounded with white cliffs,&mdash;it was black,&mdash;rocky,&mdash;it
was a sandy shore." All bawled and clamoured together.
The captain put his fingers in his ears with rage. He
had never been in before, or his men. At last, losing all
patience, the Maltese fire got up, blown to fury, and,
seizing a knife, the captain swore he would cut their
throats if they didn't hold their tongues, or give a more
distinct account of the port. This menace cowed them
down like so many bullies, and they fell into a moody
but vindictive silence, their looks discovering the internal
oaths of revenge. It was really droll, if the words used
allow the expression, to hear how the captain blended
Italian, Maltese, and Arabic oaths and abuse in his rage.
Now "<i>Santo Dio!</i>" now "<i>Scomunicat!</i>" <i>Sacrament!</i> now
"<i>Allah!</i>" "<i>Imshe</i>," "<i>Kelb</i>," "<i>Andat</i>," "<i>per Bacco!</i>" &amp;c.
At length, when a sailor from the mast-head descried
the port, and a tremendous surf was seen or said to be
seen rolling near the entrance, the Moors, who although
mostly sulky under the influence of their fatalism, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-10" id="V1-10"></a>[<a href="./images/1-10.png">10</a>]</span>
show very little courage in the dangers of the sea, cried
out with fear, "Allah, Allah!" "Ya, Mohammed!" (O
God! O God! O Mahomet!) The captain even felt
disposed to blubber at the sight of the furious surf, so
nothing less could be expected from the passengers. A
bad example is this to the sailors and people, but one
which often occurs aboard Italian and Maltese vessels.</p>

<p><i>15th.</i>&mdash;The wind continued all night and the following
day. It dropped down on the afternoon of the
16th; on the 17th a pleasant breeze sprung up, and
continued until we got within a couple of miles off
Tripoli. We were followed for three hours by a shoal
of porpoises, some nearly as big as our bark, which
enjoyed highly the run with us, "<i>perceiving</i>," as the
captain said, "<i>our motion</i>." The first night of our
anchorage in the Tripoli Vecchia, we had several alarms
that the tiny bark had dragged its anchor, and was
about to take us out into the open sea: no one could
sleep. After the wind subsided, our <i>Christian</i> sailors
were alarmed that we might have our throats cut by the
<i>Ishmaelite</i> Arabs from the shore the next night. When
it was quite calm we went on shore to search for water;
we found a well of good water on the N.E. landing
of the port. A palm beckoned us to the spring, but
a single palm is often found where there is no well or
water; and it is not true, as vulgarly supposed, that
where there are date-palms there must be water. The
country in this vicinity is a perfect desert, yet on this
arid waste shepherds drive their flocks in the spring,
and up to May and June. The captain considered
Tripoli Vecchia, which is a very ancient port, and the
site of a once famous city, more secure than that of<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-11" id="V1-11"></a>[<a href="./images/1-11.png">11</a>]</span>
Tripoli itself, though certainly much smaller. Whilst we
were here no bark visited it. Good-sized ships occasionally
anchor in it. Like Tripoli, it is defended with
a sunken reef of rocks, some peaks of which rise several
feet out of the water. Along this line is a strong surf
always chafing and roaring. There are two mouths of
entrance; the deepest water within is about twelve or
fourteen feet. There is another but much smaller port,
two miles further east; the coast from this to Tripoli
offers nothing to the tourist. Twelve miles this way
begin those forests of fine broad-waving palms, which
form so noble a feature in the suburban landscape of
Tripoli. When we got off Tripoli we had a dead calm,
and myself looking about for the wind, the Moors got
angry, and said, "Be still; if you restlessly stare about,
and wish the wind to come, it will never come: you cast
the '<i>eye malign</i>' upon it." These superstitious ideas
are not peculiar to the Moors. An English captain once
told me, if I continued to stay below, the wind would
never be fair. Tripoli looked here very bold, massive,
and imposing from the sea; its broad lime-washed
towers, and the graceful minarets beyond, all dazzling
white in the sun, contrasting with the dark blue waters
of the Mediterranean. Such is the delusion of all these
sea-coast Barbary towns; at a distance and without,
beauty and brilliancy, but near and within, filth and
wretchedness.</p>

<p>A word of my fellow passengers and crew. Our
Maltese <i>Rais</i>, although he broke his agreement with
me, behaved well; I therefore paid him, requesting the
Chancellor of our Consulate only to scold him, and warn
him for the future. He is a good Maltese Christian;<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-12" id="V1-12"></a>[<a href="./images/1-12.png">12</a>]</span>
and when I told him Malta had fifty years' possession of
Tripoli, he replied, "Ah, how the world changes! what
a pity God has given this fine country into the hands of
rascally Turks." Sometimes he would kick the Moors
about and through the ship like cattle: at other times
he would say, "Aye, come, <i>bismillah</i><a name="FNa_1-9" id="FNa_1-9"></a><a href="#FoN_1-9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>," and help them
to a part of his supper. The Moors provided for only
<i>four</i> days' provisions, a day over the average time, and
they were all out of bread before arriving at Tripoli.
The captain consulted me as to what was to be done;
we arranged to supply them with a few biscuits every
day, I taking the responsibility of payment, pitying the
poor devils. If a Moor has a good passage at sea, he
says, "Thank God!" if not, <i>Maktoub</i>, ("It is written,")
and quietly submits to the evils which he has brought on
himself by sheer imprudence. Their provisions, in this
case, consisted of barley-meal, olive-oil, a few loaves of
wheaten bread, and a little dried paste for making soup.
The soup was made of a few onions, dried peppers, salt,
oil, and the paste. On first starting, some of the more
respectable had a few hard-boiled eggs, with which the
Jews most frequently travel; and others had a little
pickled fish. When the paste was finished, the barley-meal
was attacked, and when this was gone, the greater
part lived on biscuits sopped in water. We tried to buy
a sheep from a flock driven by the shore, for which I
furnished a dollar; but the current was so strong, that
the man could not reach the land. One poor old Moor
lived actually on bread and water all the time he was on<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-13" id="V1-13"></a>[<a href="./images/1-13.png">13</a>]</span>
board, and would have nothing else, telling me, "What
God gives is enough." Yet he was cheerful and talkative.
One of the two Jews was also a very old blind
man, clothed in rags. He, too, mostly fared on biscuits
sopped in water; nevertheless, he also was quite happy!
"Where are you going, Abraham?" I said to him.
"Where God wills I go," he replied; "but I wish to
lay my poor bones in the land of our fathers. Many
long years God has afflicted us for our sins, but it will
not be for ever." The old gentleman was going to get a
passage from Tripoli to the Holy Land. How little
suffices some! How much does faith! So mysterious
are the ways of the Creator in distributing contentment.
For myself, I fared extremely well in the midst of this
<i>happy</i> mel&eacute;e of misery and starvation, Mr. Pariente, of
Jerbah, having filled for me a large box of provisions, consisting
of a leg of lamb, a fowl, pigeons, fish and bread,
besides wine and spirits. But this was as liberally distributed
amongst all as given to me, and not a crumb
was left on arriving at Tripoli. When we were getting
safe into port, I gave the grog to the crew; they had
often cast wistful eyes at the <i>acquavite</i>, but none was
poured out whilst at sea. Two or three drunken sailors
would have sent our cockle-shell to the bottom; still, in
spite of the coffee-drinking vessels, a little spirits may
occasionally be very usefully distributed to men, fighting
and wrestling with the wild waves and the tempest.
Our bark was from six to eight tons' burden, and the
cabin was just big enough for me and the captain to
move in; the woman and child slept in the forecastle,
and all the rest on deck. Each Moorish passenger paid
half a dollar for the voyage. I have been thus parti<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-14" id="V1-14"></a>[<a href="./images/1-14.png">14</a>]</span>cular
in describing our coaster and its <i>live</i> freight, to
show what misery is endured in these coasting voyages.
It was, however, a fit introduction to my painful journeyings
through the still more inhospitable <i>ocean</i> desert.</p>

<p>I have now to mention my runaway servant, Said.
This negro was the slave of Sidi Mustapha, Consular Agent
of France in Jerbah. Mustapha was formerly Consular
Agent of England, and being found to possess slaves, he
was dismissed. He got up however false documents, to
show that he had disposed of his slaves; but this being
discovered, the cheat did not avail, and he was not
allowed to be any longer England's Consul. Then,
seeing his imposture had failed, he again resumed power
over his slaves, and Said was still his slave on my
arrival at Jerbah. Hearing of this, I told Said to go on
board, and wait till the boat left. He did so. The
captain winked at it, and apparently every one else, for
Said was securely numbered on the vessel's <i>papers</i> as a
passenger. This, of course, happened before the Bey of
Tunis finally abolished slavery, which important event
took place in the beginning of the year 1846, to the
eternal honour of the reigning Mussulman prince. But,
even if slavery had continued in Tunis, Mustapha, the
French Consular Agent in Jerbah, could have had no
legal right over Said, after having given a document to
the British Consul-General, certifying that he had liberated
all his slaves. The runaway Said was in reality a
freed man. The reader, however, will be pleased to
understand that I am not justifying my conduct for enticing
a slave to run away. I despise such an attempted
justification. On the contrary, I consider that every
man, who has the means of striking off the chains from<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-15" id="V1-15"></a>[<a href="./images/1-15.png">15</a>]</span>
a slave, and does not embrace the opportunity of doing
so, is the rather the man who commits an offence against
natural right. As to the French Consular Agent, I
asked some people why the French Government did not
dismiss him also for his premeditated forgery of public
documents? I was told that, on the contrary, this was
a reason for keeping him French Consul&mdash;that he could
not be <i>disavowed</i> in connexion with <i>British</i> affairs, or,
if disavowed, he must be pensioned off. A French
Consul, whose acquaintance I made in North Africa,
replied to me, on rallying him on the various disavowals
of French functionaries in different parts of the world:
"I assure you, the only way to get distinction in our
consular service is to get disavowed. When disavowed
about English differences, we must be decorated, or the
mob of Paris and its journals would not be satisfied."</p>

<p>Our captain gave me a hint that, on arriving at Tripoli,
there would be exhibited a good deal of <i>fantazia</i>,
("humbug<a name="FNa_1-10" id="FNa_1-10"></a><a href="#FoN_1-10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>") by the health-office department. Accordingly,
after we had been an hour in port, the health
officer came alongside, and affected great surprise at our
not having <i>passports</i>, and asked me, with great pomposity,
what was my "<i>reverito nome?</i>" The Turks
always adopt and caricature the worst parts of European
civilization, leaving its better forms wholly unimitated.
This is, perhaps, in the nature of the struggles which a
semi-barbarous power may make to attain the standard
of its civilized neighbour.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-16" id="V1-16"></a>[<a href="./images/1-16.png">16</a>]</span></p>
<p>On landing, I went off with Said to the British Consulate.
Although I had seen Colonel Warrington at
Malta, I was now so sea-worn and browned with sun and
wind, with an <i>incipient</i> desert beard, that he did not
immediately recollect me. I therefore presented my
letter of introduction, mentioning my name, when at
once the Colonel recognized me. "Ah!" observed the
Colonel, "I don't believe our Government cares one
straw about the suppression of the slave-trade, but,
Richardson, I believe in you, so let's be off to my garden."
I rode one of the Colonel's horses, which had
been so long in the stable without exercise, that I found
the Barbary barb no joke. A most violent <i>gregale</i> swept
the bare beach of the harbour as we proceeded to the
gardens and plantations of the Masheeah, and the restive
prancing of the horse was not unlike the dancing
about of the cockle-shell bark to which I had been
condemned for the last ten days. The <i>British Garden</i>
I found to be a splendid horticultural developement,
containing the choicest fruit-trees of North Africa, with
ornamental trees of every shape, and hue, and foliage&mdash;all
the growth of thirty years, and the greater part of
them planted by the hands of Colonel <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Warrignton'">Warrington</ins> himself.
The villa is on the site of an ancient haunted
house&mdash;for what country does not boast of its haunted
house? The spot which once was visited nightly by
some Saracen's-head ghost, in the midst of a waste, is
now the fairest, loveliest garden of Tripoli! Amongst
its rich fruit-trees is an immense peach-tree&mdash;the largest
in all this part of Africa. It is a round, squatting,
wide-spreading tree, not nailed up to the walls, but the
size of its girth of boughs is enormous.<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-17" id="V1-17"></a>[<a href="./images/1-17.png">17</a>]</span></p>

<p>I must take the liberty of leaving off daily dates here.
I detest daily note-writing, although the reader may find
for his peculiar infliction so long a journal as these pages.</p>

<p><i>19th.</i>&mdash;A <i>ghiblee</i> day. The wind from The Desert
is coming with a vengeance. Its breath is the pure
flame of the furnace. I am obliged to tie a handkerchief
over my face in passing through the verandahs of
the garden. I had not the least idea it could be so hot
here in the middle of May. At 2 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> the thermometer
in the sun was at 142&deg; Fahrenheit.</p>

<p>Neither Tunis nor Tripoli has been sufficiently appreciated
by the politicians of Europe. Indian and American
affairs are the two ideas which occupy our merchants.
And yet the best informed of the consuls in
Tripoli say, "The future battles of Europe will be fought
in North Africa." At this time there is considerable
agitation and political intrigue afoot here. Algerian
politics, also, envenom these squabbles.</p>

<p>The aspect of the city of Tripoli is the most miserable
of all the towns I have seen in North Africa. And they
say, "It grows worse and worse." Yet the present
Pasha, Mehemet, is esteemed as a good and sensible
man. Unfortunately, a Turkish Governor can have very
little or no interest in the permanent prosperity of this
country. His tenure of office is very insecure, and rarely
extends beyond four or five years; so that whilst here
he only thinks of providing for himself. The country is
therefore in a continual state of impoverishment as
governed by successive pashas. Each successive high
functionary works and fleeces the people to the uttermost.
Even in our own colonies the exception is, that
the Governor cares more for the welfare of the colony<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-18" id="V1-18"></a>[<a href="./images/1-18.png">18</a>]</span>
than for his own immediate benefit. In Turkish colonies
we must therefore expect the rule to be, that the
Pasha should govern only for his private benefit and
personal aggrandizement.</p>

<p><i>21st.</i>&mdash;This afternoon His Highness Mehemet Pasha
had arranged to grant me an interview. I was introduced,
of course, by our Consul-General, Colonel Warrington.
Mr. Casolaina, the Chancellor of the Consulate,
and his son, were in attendance as interpreters. His
Highness receives all strangers and transacts all business
in an apartment of the celebrated old castle of the
Karamanly Bashaws, whose legends of blood and intrigue
have been so vividly and terrifically transcribed in
<i>Tully's Tripoline Letters</i>. On entering this place I was
astonished at its ruinous and repulsive appearance.
Nothing could better resemble a prison, and yet a prison
in the most dilapidated condition. Walking through the
dark, winding, damp, mildewy passages, shedding down
upon us a pestiferous dungeon influence, Colonel Warrington
suddenly stopped, as if to breathe and repel
the deadly miasma, and turning to me, said: "Well,
Richardson, what do you think of this? Capital place
this for young ladies to dance in, so light and airy.
Many a poor wretch has entered here, with promises of
fortune and royal favour, and has met his doom at the
hand of the assassin! In my long course of service,
how many Ka&euml;ds and Sheikhs I have known, who have
come in here and have never gone out. I'm a great
reader of Shakspeare. It's the next book after the
Bible. But a thousand Shakspeares, with all their tragic
genius, could never describe the passions which have
worked, and the horrors which have been perpetrated, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-19" id="V1-19"></a>[<a href="./images/1-19.png">19</a>]</span>
this place." The Colonel's tragic harangue was not without
its effect in these dungeon passages, and the old
gentleman seemed to enjoy the shiver which he saw
involuntarily agitate me. Indeed, the darksome noisome
atmosphere, without this tragic appeal, could not fail to
make itself felt, as Egyptian darkness was felt, after
leaving the fiery heat and bright dazzling sun-light without.
Winding about from one ruinous room to another,
and ascending various flights of tumbling-down steps
and stairs, we got up at length to the eastern end, where
there are two or three new apartments constructed in
the modern style. In one of them, not unlike a city
merchant's receiving-parlour, we found the Pasha and his
court. We were immediately introduced, and somewhat
to my surprise, I found His Highness an extremely plain
<i>unmilitary</i>-looking Turkish gentleman, of about fifty
years of age, and dressed without the least pretensions
of any kind. How unlike the ancient gemmed
and jewelled Bashaws! flaming in "Barbaric pearl and
gold." The present Ottoman costume is most simple.
His Highness had only the <i>Nisham</i>, or Turkish decoration
of brilliants upon his breast, to distinguish him
from his own domestics, coffee-bearers, or others. As
soon as he saw us, he hurriedly came up to us and seized
hold of our hands and shook them cordially. The troops
were at the moment being reviewed, and we had a good
sight of them from our elevated position. They were
man&#339;uvring on the sea-beach between the city and the
Masheeah. "Tell the Bashaw," cried out the Colonel to
Casolaina, "I never saw such splendid man&#339;uvring in all
the course of my life. They do His Highness and Ahmed
Bashaw, the Commander-in-Chief, infinite credit." This<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-20" id="V1-20"></a>[<a href="./images/1-20.png">20</a>]</span>
compliment was interpreted and graciously received
though its value was no doubt properly appreciated by
the politic Turk. The Colonel continued:&mdash;"Tell the
Bashaw, that as long as the Sultan has such troops as
these, he will be invincible." This was answered by,
"<i>Enshallah</i>, <i>enshallah</i>, (If God pleases, if God pleases)".
The Colonel still laid it on:&mdash;"Casolaina, tell the Bashaw,
I myself should not like to command even English troops
against these fine fellows." To which the Bashaw and
his Court replied, "<i>Ajeeb</i>, (Wonderful!)" Ahmed Bashaw,
the Commander-in-Chief, a most ferocious-looking Turk,
seized hold of my shoulders and pushed me to the window
to admire his brilliant men. I could just see that their
man&#339;uvrings were in the style of the "awkward squad;"
but their arms and white pantaloons dazzled beautifully
in the sun upon the margin of the deep-blue sea.</p>

<p>After we had satisfied our curiosity or admiration in
looking at the troops, the windows were shut down, and
all sat down to business. His Highness began by asking
my name, when I came, and what I was going to be
about? The Consul replied to these first and usual
questions of Turkish functionaries, and more particularly
explained my projected visit to Ghadames. The Pasha
immediately consented, as a matter of course, with
Turkish politeness; but before the interview was concluded,
various objections were started and insisted upon,
showing the <i>not</i> suddenly excited jealousy of these functionaries,
who, previous to my interview, knew all about
my anti-slavery and literary projects. His Highness
observed:&mdash;"The heat is killing now, the distance is
great, the road is infested with robbers; I shall have to
send an escort of five hundred troops with your friend,<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-21" id="V1-21"></a>[<a href="./images/1-21.png">21</a>]</span>
(addressing the Consul); not long ago two hundred
banditti attacked a caravan. All Tunisian Arabs are
robbers; the Bey of that country cannot maintain order
in his country; besides, an Arab will kill ten men to
get one pair of pistols; but I'll make further inquiries."
His Highness also related a feat of his own troops, who
captured seven camels from the banditti, which he said
he distributed amongst the captors. He also gave his
own people, the Tripolines, a very bad character. But,
of course, the Tripolines and the Turks must mutually
hate one another. We were served with pipes, coffee,
and sherbet. I pretended to sip the pipe two or three
times, as a matter of politeness, for though I have been
in Barbary some time, where smoking is universal, I have
not adopted the dirty vice. Near the Pasha sat the
second in command, or Commander-in-Chief of the forces,
the Pasha himself devoting his attention almost exclusively
to civil affairs. As I have said, this functionary
was a most savage-looking fellow, and his acts in
Tripoli and his reputation accord with the character
broadly stamped on his countenance. He has risen from
the lowest ranks&mdash;one of the <i>canaille</i> of the Levant&mdash;and
is blood-thirsty and vindictive whenever he has the
means of showing these dreadful passions. How many
tyrants have risen from the ranks of those who are the
victims and objects of tyranny!</p>

<p>The Consul hinted to me afterwards, that this military
tyrant would oppose my journey to the interior, and
throw all sorts of obstacles in the way, but thought the
Pasha would not listen to his insinuations. On asking
the Consul what he thought of the objections of the
Pasha? he said: "Oh, they are only to increase the
merit of his facilitating your trip." Mehemet Pasha has<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-22" id="V1-22"></a>[<a href="./images/1-22.png">22</a>]</span>
the rank of three tails, and the Pasha of the Troops
two tails. There was present also Mohammed Aly, a
Moor, who interprets between the Moors and Arabs, and
the Turks. He is said to be entirely in the interest of
the English. He frequently visits the Vice-Consul, Mr.
Herbert Warrington, who treats the interpreter with
a bottle of champaigne, and in this way things are
greatly smoothed down before His Highness. A glass of
wine is often more potent than an elaborate speech in
these and other diplomatic transactions. It is but justice
to these functionaries to say, whatever money they
may take away from Tripoli, that they are very moderate
in their style of living and dress in this place. The apartment
in which we were received was exceedingly plain.
All the furniture was of the most ordinary European
stuff; there was nothing oriental in it but a large square
ottoman. A few flowers were placed gracefully on the
table, and there was a pretty bronzed lamp. We visitors
sat on cane-bottomed chairs. The costume of these high
functionaries was the usual large Turkish frock-coat,
tightly buttoned up, and white or other light-coloured
pantaloons, for summer wear, and these strapped over
thick heavy black leather shoes, the straps often inside
the shoes as an Ottoman improvement on the European
fashion. The head was covered with the <i>shasheeah</i>, or
fez, with a large blue silk tassel hanging prettily from the
crown. On the breast hung the <i>Nisham</i> decoration, distinguishing
the various grades and rank.</p>

<p>We left His Highness under the impression that he
would do every thing in his power to forward our views,
and never dreamt of a future memorandum of recall
after having reached Ghadames with His Highness's permission.<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-23" id="V1-23"></a>[<a href="./images/1-23.png">23</a>]</span></p>

<p>It is not now my intention to give an account of
Tripoli, so I pass on to a second interview I had with the
Bashaw. This was on the 7th of July. In this long
interval, I had been waiting for letters from England, and
in every way was learning lessons of most imperturbable
patience.</p>

<p>I was visiting some sick officers in the castle with a
Maltese doctor of the name of <i>Gameo</i>, whose acquaintance
I had made, and whom I found useful in collecting
information on Tripoli and the interior, when one of the
functionaries of the Castle came to tell me the Bashaw
would like to see me. I felt some delicacy in going, but
thought it better to comply with the wish of His Highness.
There was immediately presented to me, as usual
to all visitors, a pipe, coffee, and sherbet. Our interview
lasted about half an hour, and the conversation was <i>to
the point</i>, referring solely to my journey to the interior.
But, although I exerted all my skill and tact, I could not
remove the jealousies of His Highness, and I believe for
one, and only one reason. It had been given out in
Tripoli that I was to be appointed Consul at Ghadames.
The Bashaw fearing that such an appointment would
interfere with his system of extorting money from the
inhabitants of that country (the treasury being empty in
Tripoli), set his face against my journey, and endeavoured
to delay it until he could get a <i>counter</i> order
from Constantinople. His Highness was however very
polite, and promised to furnish me with tents, if I had
need, and a large escort. The Turks are getting sensitive
of the press. The Bashaw said he had heard I was a
great newspaper writer, and asked me if I had any objection
to writing an article in his praise.<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-24" id="V1-24"></a>[<a href="./images/1-24.png">24</a>]</span></p>

<p>At the end of the month of July (30th), Colonel
Warrington suggested to me the propriety of writing to
him a letter, stating my wish and objects in visiting the
interior. I did so, and received an answer from the
Colonel the same day. Mr. Frederick Warrington, who
had great influence with several people about His Highness,
and myself, went again to the Bashaw, in order to
conciliate His Highness and persuade him to give a
<i>bon&acirc; fide</i> protection to me through the interior of
Tripoli, as also to obtain a passport. It unfortunately
happened, that about a week ago, a Ghadames caravan
had been captured by some hostile Arabs on the frontiers
of Tunis. His Highness immediately produced this case,
and said it was impossible for me to go whilst the routes
were so insecure. He also alleged, and with more
reason:&mdash;"The season was now too late, the heat was
intolerable, and an European of my delicate constitution
must succumb." We therefore returned much depressed.
Colonel Warrington then, annoyed at the Bashaw's
resistance, wrote the next day a letter to his Chancellor,
requesting him to wait upon the Bashaw, and demand
formally a passport for me, my servant, and camel-driver.
I went with Mr. Casolaina, but did not see His Highness,
waiting only at the door of the hall of audience, in case
I should be wanted. His Highness apologized for his
opposition, stating his objections of the season and the
insecurity of the routes, but gave the order for the passports.
I find the following note in my journal:&mdash;"Left
Tripoli for Ghadames on the 2nd August, 1845; I had
grown completely tired of Tripoli, and left it without a
single regret, having suffered much from several sources
of annoyance, including both the Consulate and the
Bashaw."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nothing</span> is more common than that, after long delay
and various negotiations, in waiting and preparing for a
journey, everything at last is hurried with a most reckless
dispatch; this, at least, was the case with me. I
was to have been escorted out of Tripoli by the Consular
corps, with the British Consul at their head, in the
wonted style of Europeans setting out for the interior.
But on the morning of the 2nd August, before I could
finish my letters for England, or get my luggage together,
came my camel-driver Mohammed, who, at the
sight of my papers all spread out, began whining and
blubbering, protesting, "The <i>ghafalah</i><a name="FNa_1-11" id="FNa_1-11"></a><a href="#FoN_1-11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> is gone; we can't
overtake it&mdash;we shall be murdered, if we delay behind."
Without saying a word in reply, I amassed and bundled<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-26" id="V1-26"></a>[<a href="./images/1-26.png">26</a>]</span>
up everything together, and gave him the baggage; then
went off to the <i>Souk</i>, or market-place, to buy some fresh
bread,&mdash;and found myself on the way to Ghadames, before
I was conscious of having left Tripoli. Such is the excitement
and vagaries of human feeling! Not being
accustomed to mount the camel, I determined to hire
some donkeys to ride to the first station; Gameo and
one of his brothers accompanied me. When I could
breathe freely, as I rode on my unknown way, with a
boundless prospect before me, I felt my heart rebound
with joy, and commended myself humbly to the care of
a good God, not knowing what was to happen to me. I
had consumed three months of most suffering patience in
Tripoli before I could start on this journey, and was
otherwise schooled for what was about to take place. But
I must not begin too early the record of my complaints.</p>

<p>Our first day's ride was mostly through desert lands,
for The Desert reaches to the walls of the city of Tripoli.
The little village of Gargash was seen at our
right, near the margin of the sea. Gameo exclaimed,
"There's the little mosque&mdash;there's the little cemetery&mdash;there
are the little gardens, little palms!"&mdash;and little
this, and little the other: indeed, it was a perfect miniature
of congregated human existence. Arrived at Janzour,
Gameo and his brother prepared to return. But
previous to his leaving, Gameo, who was a tabeeb of
great notoriety, determined to display his healing art.
He took out his lancet, and forthwith bled everybody
in the Ka&euml;d's caravanseria. When his brother begged
of him not to bleed any more people unless they paid
him something&mdash;not to be such a <i>sciocco</i> ("ninny,") he
turned round upon him, and indignantly exclaimed<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-27" id="V1-27"></a>[<a href="./images/1-27.png">27</a>]</span>
"Ancora voglio lasciare il mio nome qui" (Here I will
leave my name also!) It was the delight of Gameo to
be the grand tabeeb of Tripoli, and even to prescribe for
the officers and subordinate bashaws; and yet Gameo
and his family many days were without bread to eat, to
my certain knowledge. I relieved them as much as I
could. The Moors and Arabs are very funny about
bleeding, and the matters of the tabeeb; they will ask
you to bleed them when in perfect health. All these
persons who were bled at Janzour had no ailments;
they will also swallow physic, whether well or ill. One
of them consulted Gameo privately how he was to
obtain children from his wife, who was barren. Another
wished to obtain the affections of a girl by administering
to her a dose of medicine. They consider a doctor in
the light, in which our fathers of the time of Friar Bacon
did, of a magician, and a person who holds some sort of
illicit intercourse with the devil, or, at any rate, with
the genii. They never give the doctor credit for his
skill, but attribute his wit and success to the blessing or
interposition of God.</p>

<p>After taking leave of Gameo, I waited for Mohammed
and Said; we had gone on quickly with the donkeys.
They came up with the camels, but instead of encamping
within the village, the ghafalah had brought up outside.
This annoyed Mohammed, who kept exclaiming,
as we went to the rendezvous of the merchants, "Ah!
Gameo, that's him, Gameo, Gameo! What trouble he
has brought upon us, Gameo! Gameo! he a tabeeb?
Not fit to give physic to a dog. Gameo! Gameo!
always talking&mdash;always talking; the devil take him, for
he's his son." We reached the encampment as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-28" id="V1-28"></a>[<a href="./images/1-28.png">28</a>]</span>
shadows of night fell fast; we did not take supper, or
pitch tent. My spirits gave way, and I felt fearful and
saddened at the prospect of going into the interior absolutely
alone. I had not a single letter of recommendation
to any one, after waiting so long at Tripoli, and so
much talk with all sorts of people about the necessity of
having letters for the chiefs of The Desert. This was,
indeed, bad management; yet I could not insist upon
the Pasha giving me a letter, nor could I importune the
British Consul: but it often happens, where there is less
help from man, there is more from God. Many of the
Ghadamsee merchants, whose acquaintance I had made
in Tripoli, came now to me and welcomed me as a
fellow-traveller. Janzour is a small village, with gardens
of olives and date plantations.</p>

<p><i>August 3rd.</i>&mdash;Before starting to-day, it is necessary to
give some account of my equipment. I had two camels
on hire, for which I paid twelve dollars. I was to ride
one continually. We had panniers on it, in which I
stowed away about two months' provisions. A little fresh
provision we were to purchase <i>en route</i>. Upon these
panniers a mattress was placed, forming with them a
comfortable platform. As a luxury, I had a Moorish
pillow for leaning on, given me by Mr. Frederick Warrington.
The camel was neither led nor reined, but
followed the group. I myself was dressed in light European
clothes, and furnished with an umbrella for keeping
off the sun. This latter was all my arms of offence and
defence. The other camel carried a trunk and some
small boxes, cooking utensils, and matting, and a very
light tent for keeping off sun and heat. We had two
gurbahs, or "skin-bags for water," and another we were<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-29" id="V1-29"></a>[<a href="./images/1-29.png">29</a>]</span>
to buy in the mountains, so each having a skin of
water to himself. Said was to ride this camel, and
now and then give a ride to Mohammed the camel-driver,
to whom the camels belonged. We were roused before
daylight. I made coffee with my spirit apparatus (<i>spiriterio</i>).
In half an hour after the dawn, we were all on
the move, and soon started. The ghafalah presented an
interminable line of camels, as it wound its slow way
through narrow sandy lanes, hedged on each side with
the cactus or prickly-pear. We progressed very irregularly,
and the camels kept throwing off their burdens.
The Moors and Arabs, who manage almost everything
badly, even hardly know how to manage their camels,
after ages of experience. It is, however, very difficult
to drive the camels past a prickly-pear hedge, they being
voraciously fond of the huge succulent leaves of this
plant, and crop them with the most savage greediness,
regardless of the continual blows, accompanied with loud
shouts, which they receive from the vociferous drivers to
get them forward. I wore my cloak for two hours after
dawn, and felt chilly, and yet at noonday the thermometer
was at least 130&deg; Fah., in the sun. We emerged
from the prickly-pear hedges upon an open desert land.
Here was an encampment of Arabs, with tents as "black"
and "comely" in this glare and fire of the full morning
sun, as "the tents of Kedar!" (See Solomon's Songs i.
5.) Nothing indeed is more refreshing than the sight of
these black camel's-hair tents, when travelling over these
arid thirsty plains. The whole households of the tents
were alive, but their various occupations will be seen
better in the following sketch than pictured to the mind
by any elaborate description.<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-30" id="V1-30"></a>[<a href="./images/1-30.png">30</a>]</span></p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill1-04.jpg"><img src="./images/ill1-04_th.jpg" alt="Arab Tents" title="Arab Tents" /></a></p>

<p>Encamped at Jedaeem about 10 o'clock, <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> Remained
here only two hours and proceeded to Zouweeah,
a large village, situate in the midst of most pleasant gardens,
or rather cultivated lands, overshadowed with date
groves. These gardens are considered superior to those
of the Masheeah around Tripoli. Passed through the
whole district by 3 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, and then entered what is usually
called the Sahara, this side the Mountains. This desert
presents sand hills, loose stones scattered about, dwarf
shrubs, long coarse grass, and sometimes small undulations
of rocky ground. It is, however, overrun by a few
nomade tribes, who feed their flocks on the ungrateful
and scant herbage which it affords. Tripoli, in general
offers a remarkable contrast to Tunis and other parts of
Barbary, in having its Arab tribes located in stone and
mud houses or fixed douwars, whilst nomade Arabs are
found thickly scattered all over the West, as far as the
Atlantic. Zouweeah is the last <i>belad</i>, or <i>paesi</i>, (<i>i. e.</i>, "cul<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-31" id="V1-31"></a>[<a href="./images/1-31.png">31</a>]</span>tivated
country,") before we reach The Mountains, which
are two days' journey distant. I therefore sent Mohammed
to buy a small sheep, but he could not succeed
although there were many flocks about, the people absurdly
refusing to sell them, even when the full price was
offered. The Arabs themselves never eat meat as the
rule, but the exception, supporting themselves on the
milk of their flocks and farinaceous matter. Olive-oil
and fat and fruit they devour. Of vegetables they eat,
but with little <i>gusto</i>. Their flocks are kept as a sort of
reserve wealth, and to pay their contributions. Our
course to-day and yesterday was west and south-west.
At sunset we encamped at Beer-el-Hamra ("red-well"),
which is a well-spring of very good water, ten feet deep,
the water issuing from the sides of the rocky soil. Here
we found artificial pits or troughs for the sheep and
cattle to drink from, and trunks of the date-palms hollowed
out for the camels. When a ghafalah passes a
well there is the greatest confusion to get all the camels
to drink, and the people quarrel and fight about this, as
well as for their turn to fill their water-skins. This quarrelling
at the wells forcibly reminds the Biblical reader
of the contest of Moses in favour of the daughters of
Jethro against the ungallant shepherds. (Exodus i. 17.)
We take in no more water till we get to The Mountains.</p>

<p>Here mention must be made of the strength of our caravan,
as all are to rendezvous at this well for safety, to start
together over The Desert to The Mountains. It was half
a day's advance of this where the Ghadamsee ghafalah had
been lately plundered of all its goods and camels. As
soon as the Seb&acirc;ah banditti appeared, the merchants, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-32" id="V1-32"></a>[<a href="./images/1-32.png">32</a>]</span>
were without escort, all ran away like frightened gazelles.
One man alone had his arm scratched. Our ghafalah,
besides casual travellers going to The Mountains, consisted
of some two hundred camels, laden chiefly with
merchandize for the interior, Soudan, and Timbuctoo.
Thirty or forty merchants, nearly all of Ghadames, to
whom the goods belong, accompany these camels. To
ascertain its value would be hopeless, for the merchants,
with the real jealousy of mercantile rivalry, conceal their
affairs from one another. Two of the principal Ghadamsee
merchants are with us, the Sheikh Makouran
and Haj Mansour, besides a son of the great house of
Ettence. These merchants belong to the rival factions of
the city, and accordingly have separate encampments.
The greater number of the merchants of our ghafalah
are only petty traders, some with only a camel-load of
merchandize. We are escorted by sixty Arab troops on
foot, with a commandant and some subordinate sheikhs
on horseback. They are to protect us to The Mountains,
where it is said all danger ends. They are poor, miserable
devils to look at, hungry, lank, lean, and browned to
blackness, armed with matchlocks, which continually miss
fire, and covered with rags, or mostly having only a single
blanket to cover their dirty and emaciated bodies. Some
are without shoes, and others have a piece of camel's
skin cut in the shape of a sole of the foot, and tied up
round the ankles: some have a scull-cap, white or red,
and others are bare-headed. I laughed when I surveyed
with my inexperienced eye these grisly, skeleton, phantom
troops, and thought of the splendid invincible guard
which the Pasha promised me. And yet amongst these
wretched beings was riding sublime an Arab Falstaff.<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-33" id="V1-33"></a>[<a href="./images/1-33.png">33</a>]</span></p>

<p><i>4th.</i>&mdash;Morning. Find the greater part of the ghafalah
has not yet come up. We are to wait for them, being
the advanced body. Expect them in the afternoon.
It is exceedingly difficult to keep these various groups of
merchants together; each group is its own sovereign
master and will have its own way. The commandant
is constantly swearing at each party to get all to march
together; now and then he draws his sword and shakes it
over their heads. "You are dogs," he says to one;
"you are worse than this Christian Kafer amongst us,"
(myself,) he bawls to another.</p>

<p>Have, thank God, suffered little up to now, although
intensely hot in the day-time, and my eyes so bad that I
cannot look at the sun, and scarcely on daylight without a
shade. They were bad on leaving Tripoli, having caught
a severe ophthalmia from the refraction of the hot rocks
when bathing. My left arm is also still very weak, from
the accident of falling into a dry well a little before I
started. I can't mount the camel without assistance, but
begin to ride without that sickly sensation, not unlike
sea-sickness, which I felt the first day's riding. Drink
brandy frequently, but in small quantities and greatly
diluted, and find great benefit from it; drink also coffee
and tea. Eat but little, and scarcely any meat. The
Arabs of the country brought a few sheep to sell this
morning, but asked double the Tripoli price; so nobody
purchased. Bought myself a fowl for eighty Turkish
paras. The people of the ghafalah civil, but all the
lower classes will beg continually if you are willing to
give. Each one offers his advice and consolation on my
tour; but Mohammed keeps all the hungry Arabs at a
respectable distance, lest I should give to them what<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-34" id="V1-34"></a>[<a href="./images/1-34.png">34</a>]</span>
belongs to his share, like servants who don't wish their
masters to be generous to others if it interferes with their
own prerogatives.</p>

<p>We left in the afternoon and encamped in The Desert
at Shouwabeeah. The Desert here presents nothing but
long coarse grass and undulating ground. I observed a
patch which had been cultivated, the stubble of barley
remaining, which the camels devoured most voraciously.
Chopped barley-straw is the favourite food of all animals
of burden in North Africa; horses will feed on it for six
months together, and get fat. <i>En route</i> the chief of the
escort had great trouble to keep the caravan together;
he made the advanced parties wait till the others
came up, so as all to be ready in case of attack. One
would think the merchants, for their own sakes, would
keep together; but no, it's all <i>maktoub</i> with them; "If
they are to be robbed and murdered they must be robbed
and murdered, and the Bashaw and all his troops can't
prevent it." This they reiterated to me whilst the commandant
bullied them; and yet these same men had
each of them a matchlock and pistols besides. The
Sheikh Makouran had no less than four guns on his
camel. I asked him what they were for. He coolly
replied, "I don't know. God knows." The camels
browse or crop herbage all the way along, daintily picking
and choosing the herbage and shrubs which they like
best. My chief occupation in riding is watching them
browse, and observing the epicurean fancies of these
reflective, sober-thinking brutes of The Desert. I observe
also as a happy trait in the Arab, that nothing delights
him more than watching his own faithful camel graze.
The ordinary drivers sometimes allow them to graze,<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-35" id="V1-35"></a>[<a href="./images/1-35.png">35</a>]</span>
and wait till they have cropped their favourite herbage
and shrubs, and at other times push them forward
according to their caprice. The camel, with an intuitive
perception, knows all the edible and delicate herbs and
shrubs of The Desert, and when he finds one of his
choicest it is difficult to get him on until he has cropped
a good mouthful. But I shall have much to write of
this sentient "ship of The Desert." It is hard to
forget the ship which carries one safely over the ocean,
whose plank intervenes between our life and a bottomless
grave of waters: so we tourists of The Desert acquire a
peculiar affection for the melancholy animal, whose slow
but faithful step carries us through the hideous wastes of
sand and stone, where all life is extinct, and where, if
left a moment behind the camel's track, certain death
follows.</p>

<p><i>5th.</i>&mdash;Rose at daybreak, and pursued our way through
the Desert. Saw the mountains early, stretching far
away east and west in undefined and shadowy but glorious
magnificence,&mdash;some of deep black hue, and others
reddened over with the morning sunbeams. It is a gladdening,
elevating sight. The presence of a vast range of
mountains always raises the mind and imagination of
man. Encamped during the <i>Kailah</i> &#8238;&#1602;&#1575;&#1610;&#1604;&#1577;&#8236;, or from 10
o'clock <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, to 3 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> This is the siesta of the
Spaniards, and it is probable the Moors introduced it
into Spain. It is also the mezzogiorno of the Italians
and the Frank population of Barbary. But the Italians
usually dine before they take their midday nap. Our
object here is to shelter ourselves from the greatest force
of the heat of the day. None of us dine. In the
afternoon the Arab soldiers, being without water, began<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-36" id="V1-36"></a>[<a href="./images/1-36.png">36</a>]</span>
to seize that of the merchants, after having demanded it
from them in vain. In one case they robbed a merchant
under the pretext of getting water. They also attempted
to take water from my camels, but I resisted, threatening
to report them to the Bashaw. After a scuffle with my
negro servant and camel-driver, in which affair Said drew
out manfully from the scabbard the old rusty sword
which I presented to him on leaving Tripoli&mdash;to gird
round him as a warrior badge&mdash;they desisted and
retreated. The sub-officer of the escort came up to me
afterwards, and begged that I would say nothing about
the business. I gave him a suck of brandy-and-water,
and we were mighty good friends all the way. Our
course was south to-day, striking directly at The Mountains.
We encamped about midnight at the Wady
Lethel, the name of which is derived from the tree
<i>Lethel</i> &#8238;&#1604;&#1584;&#1604;&#8236;, frequent in the Sahara.</p>

<p>With regard to the conduct of the poor Arab soldiers,
justice requires it to be said, that they are allowed
nothing for the service of the escort, whilst if they do
not serve when they are called upon, they are fined. The
consequence is, they generally have nothing to eat, and
no skins to put their water in. Perhaps a camel with a
couple of skins is allowed to twenty men. As there was
water for scarcely two days of our slow marching, (we
only march about twelve hours per day,) these miserable
victims of Turkish rule had no water left. It is hunger
and misery in this, as in most cases amongst the poor,
and not the native unwillingness of the heart to perform
good actions, which excite them to deeds of violence and
plunder. This night the heavens presented an appearance
of unexampled serenity and soft splendour; all the<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-37" id="V1-37"></a>[<a href="./images/1-37.png">37</a>]</span>
constellations glowed with a steady beauteous light; there
were the "sweet influences of Pleiades," the bright
"bands of Orion," "Arcturus with his sons," and the infinitude
of sparkling jewels in "chambers of the South."
All the stars might be seen and counted, so distinctly
visible were they to the naked unassisted eye. In encamping
our ghafalah carried on its delightful system of
confusion, and the night fires of the various groups glared
wildly in every direction. I had not yet become familiar
with these nocturnal lights of Saharan travelling, and my
senses were confounded. I felt tormented as with an
enchanter's delusive fire-works in some half-waking
dream.</p>

<p><i>6th.</i>&mdash;Rose at day-break. Our route was now over
a vast level plain, and we were within four hours of The
Mountains. They now discovered the true Atlas features,
a part of which chain they were. We marched in
the most glorious disorder. Some were before, some
behind, straggling along, others far to the right, and
others as far to the left, a mile or two apart. We had
the appearance of an immense line moving on to invest
The Mountains <i>en masse</i>, for there seemed to be no common
point to which we were advancing in such tumultuous
array. The Arabs pay little attention to marching
in order, and in a straight line, so that the camels
traverse double the quantity of ground that there would
be any occasion for did they attend to plain common
sense. The Desert now showed more signs of cultivation,
and, indeed, a great portion of this so-called Desert is
only land uncultivated, but capable of the highest degree
of cultivation;&mdash;all which might be effected by supplying
any scarcity of rain by irrigation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-38" id="V1-38"></a>[<a href="./images/1-38.png">38</a>]</span></p>

<p>We passed the kailah, or in Scripture phrase, "the
heat of the day," at a place called A&acirc;eeat, below The
Mountains, where we found two wells without water, or
with very little bad, dirty, nay, black water. Nevertheless,
many descended these wells, about thirty feet deep,
to bring up the muddy filthy water, and swallowed it
immediately. I myself was so thirsty, that I drank it
greedily. Said had very severe thirst, and I believe he
drank in one of the last two days nearly a bucket and a
half of water. I finished two bottles of brandy, having
diluted it with large quantities of water. I believe this
was the only thing which kept me alive, the heat was so
intense and prostrating in the day-time. I am astonished
to see these people descend into the wells with
such facility. I expected, on the contrary, to see them
break their necks. They descend by the sides, only
assisted by their hands and feet, clinging to naked
stones, the interstices of which in some places not even
allowing space on which to rest the foot. Here again is
hubbub and vociferation of the wildest form, all sorts of
quarrelling over this sewer-like water. I now, for the
first time in my life, experienced the real value of water,
and in these climates more clearly understood the vivid
and frequent allusions in the Holy Scriptures to this
essential element of existence. Mohammed went several
miles in The Mountains, and returned with a skin of fresh
water. In his absence the torment of thirst prostrated
me, and I lay senseless on the ground:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The water! the water!</span>
<span class="i1">My heart yet burns to think,</span>
<span class="i0">How cool thy fountain sparkled forth,</span>
<span class="i1">For parched lips to drink."</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-39" id="V1-39"></a>[<a href="./images/1-39.png">39</a>]</span></div></div>

<p>After the Kailah, we ascended that portion of the
Tripoline chain of the Atlas called Yefran. This chain
has various names, according to its different links, or
groups, more properly, for the usual phenomena of the
Atlas are groups, pile upon pile. The following are
some of the principal names of this part of the Atlas,
beginning east and proceeding west: Gharian, Kiklah,
Yefran or <i>Jibel</i>, ("Mountain," par excellence,) Nouwaheeha,
Khalaeefah, Reeaneen, Zantan, Rujban, Douweerat.
All these larger districts are divided into smaller
ones, descending to very minute subdivisions. Every
dell, and copse, and glade, and brook, and stream, and
drain, (to use English nomenclature,) of these mountains,
is defined, and owned, and cultivated, as the most
cultivated, divided, and subdivided estate in England.
It is quite ridiculous to look upon the Atlas chains as so
many vast uninhabited wastes. The French, whose forte
in colonization is blundering, rushed into the plateaus
and groups of the Atlas as into lands unowned and
undefined, and were quite astonished to hear of claimants
for their newly acquired lands and farms. They
imagined that the plains of the Metidjah and the adjacent
Atlas chain had lain desolate since the Creation, or
were only wandered over by savage hordes of barbarians.</p>

<p>We found the ascent of Yefran difficult. The Arabs
call all places difficult of traverse, W&acirc;r&mdash;&#8238;&#1608;&#1593;&#1585;&#8236;&mdash;whether applied
to stony rocky ground, sandy regions, or mountains.
The camels in the ascent are timid, and besides the evident
fatigue which they experience, show great caution,
picking slowly their way with the greatest circumspection.
Only a portion of the ghafalah got up to-day.
Some camels were labouring up the mountain sides,<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-40" id="V1-40"></a>[<a href="./images/1-40.png">40</a>]</span>
others threw off their burdens and stood still. As our
party was always the advanced, we managed to get
up soon. Beneath a huge old black olive-tree, which
seemed to have begun with Creation, but still as vigorous
as ever, we found a comfortable shade in a snug retired
place. It was cooler on the top of The Mountains, and
I took a walk in the evening to the Castle (Kesar) of
Yefran, a most formidable thing to look at from a distance,
but a wretched mud-built place in reality. To
the Arabs, however, it is a terrible bulwark of strength,
and for them impregnable. Everything in the shape of a
fort or a blockhouse, be it ever so untenable or miserable,
terrifies the Arabs. It is repeatedly asserted that the
Arabs of Algeria never took a blockhouse. An authentic
anecdote was recently related to me of a French civilian
keeping a whole tribe in check for two days, by fortifying
his house and firing from loop-holes which he made in
its walls. Not so the Kabyles. Their genius is defending
their little forts, often constructed of loose stones, in
their mountain homes. Behind these and other forts of
nature they maintain for days an obstinate resistance,
and pour deadly mitraille. The Turkish soldiers were
here lounging about; they gaped and stared at me.
I am, perhaps, the first European who has been to
Yefran in the memory of the present generation, nay,
the first European Christian who has visited this spot.
The sun now set fiery red, and night was fast veiling
The Mountains with her sable curtain. I retired to my
olive-tree, and under its shade slept most profoundly.
This was repose&mdash;this, sleep! I shall never sleep in
more profound slumbers until I sleep my last.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>7th.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Was</span> awaked by a young man, who said he had
brought for "the Consul of Ghadames" (myself) a brace
of partridges, some milk, and grapes, from the secretary
of the Commandant. Drank a large basin of milk and
coffee, and went to pay a visit to the Commandant.
Found all the principal Ghadamsee merchants at the
Castle, closeted in a small apartment with the Commandant,
Ahmed Effendi, talking over the affairs of the
ghafalah. At first I imagined this officer had brought
them up from Yefran to make them pay black-mail in
various presents. But it was only his vanity which<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-42" id="V1-42"></a>[<a href="./images/1-42.png">42</a>]</span>
dragged up the poor camels this fatiguing route, an ascent
of four hours. Our direct route to Ghadames would have
been half a day farther west. He said he had merely
sent for the merchants to ask them how they were, and
give them his blessing. When I entered, a stool was
brought me to sit upon. The Rais<a name="FNa_1-12" id="FNa_1-12"></a><a href="#FoN_1-12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> was seated on a
raised bench covered with an ottoman, and the merchants
were squatted on their hams upon the matting and carpets
of the floor. Coffee was brought me, as to most
visitors. The Rais asked me where I was going? and
what I was doing? as if he knew nothing about me. I
then had my palaver, and represented to the Rais the
case of taking by force water from the merchants, which
took him quite aback, and astonished all present, the
merchants secretly admiring the boldness of the remonstrance.
But it was one of those unpleasant duties
which are absolutely necessary to be performed. In
our case it was necessary for our own health and the
order and security of the caravan. The Rais surprised
and displeased, nevertheless gave strict orders that it
should not happen again. The merchants afterwards
expressed their thanks to me; seeing plainly also the advantage
of having one amongst them who was not immediately
subject to the Pasha and his soldiers. Besides,
I hinted to the Rais it would be better if the ghafalah
marched more in order, and had a chief. This the Rais
discussed with the merchants, and it was considered
advisable to adopt these common sense measures, they,
however, laughing heartily at my European ideas of
order. I then begged the Rais to persuade the people to<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-43" id="V1-43"></a>[<a href="./images/1-43.png">43</a>]</span>
travel by night, as this was the hottest season in the
year, and being a new traveller in The Desert, I could
scarcely support the heat. He replied it would be better
for all as we were not now likely to be molested with
hostile Arabs. Before separating, a marabout made a
short prayer (the <i>fatah</i>) for the safety of the caravan.
This prayer, the first chapter of the Koran, is never
omitted on these occasions. Ahmed Effendi is a very
smart Turk, in the vigour of age and health, and has the
character of being very stringent in his administration.
People call him "<i>kus</i>," or hard and determined in disposition;
but he is not ferocious, like the Commander-in-Chief.
His countenance betrayed a very active intelligence.
He said to me aside: "Now these people you are
travelling with are barbarians; you must humour their
whims and respect their religion. If they were not now
present, we would have a bottle of wine together."</p>

<p>The garrison of Yefran contains some two or three
hundred Turkish soldiers, as also that of Gharian, besides
Arab troops. The Arabs of these districts are entirely
subdued, their native courage apparently dried up and
extinct. This has been done chiefly by forced emigration
or extermination. The French acquired their
<i>razzia</i> system from the Turks whom they found in possession
of the government of Algiers, on the conquest of
that country; but they have improved on it, for a superior
intelligence imitating a bad system, will always
increase its cruelty and wickedness. We passed many
villages depopulated, their humble dwellings razed to the
ground&mdash;the work of the ferocious Ahmed Bashaw, who
came in person to these mountains. A great deal of
fighting had taken place near the Castle, and there were<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-44" id="V1-44"></a>[<a href="./images/1-44.png">44</a>]</span>
the ruins of a very large village on one of the neighbouring
peaks. Yefran is a very strong position, and was
hotly contested by both parties. In all these mountain
districts very few inhabitants are seen, and the present
cultivation is therefore insignificant. The people are
without money or stock, and have scarcely anything to
eat. The single advantage of Turkish rule here is, a
large military road cut from the plain to the summit, on
which the fort stands, but, of course, as a military road,
it was not made specifically for the improvement of the
people. Certainly the Turks must show more civilized
and polite manners to the mountaineers, but the Arabs
will not imitate them, or, if anything they do imitate, as
in the case of all subjected nations in relation to their conquerors,
it is the vices of their masters. It is unfortunately
much the same when the Turks imitate us Christians.</p>

<p>Bought some meat cheap at Yefran, but my camel-driver
afterwards stole the greater part. The secretary
of the Rais, Bou Asher, who knew the Vice-consul of
Fezzan, showed me some kindness, and sent me again
milk, which he said was the right of "The Consul." I
had also received a nice delicious little present of a melon
from the Sheikh Makouran <i>en route</i>. These were the
first proofs of a friendly disposition of the natives
towards me, and were most thankfully appreciated.
The people called me <i>Taleb</i> ("learned man"), or <i>Tabeeb</i>
("doctor"), or Consul, or the Christian, just as their caprice
or information led them<a name="FNa_1-13" id="FNa_1-13"></a><a href="#FoN_1-13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>. Here all the merchants<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-45" id="V1-45"></a>[<a href="./images/1-45.png">45</a>]</span>
determined to stop a week, some going to one part of The
Mountains, and some to the other, to purchase oil, barley
and <i>gurbahs</i> ("water-skins"). Many travellers, who had
availed themselves of our escort to The Mountains, here
left us.</p>

<p>I left in the afternoon for the native country of my
camel-driver, and encamped for the night in The Mountains.
Our party consisted only of the camel-driver,
Said, and myself, with three camels. I must say I felt
rather queer knocking about in The Mountains, almost
alone.</p>

<p><i>8th.</i>&mdash;Rose early, and pursued our way. The air of
this elevated region invigorated my mind and body; and
so by a mishap I took no coffee before starting. Passed
the kailah under a group of olive trees, called "The
Sisters<a name="FNa_1-14" id="FNa_1-14"></a><a href="#FoN_1-14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>," where also flocks of sheep and shepherds were
dosing and reposing under the shade. We exchanged
biscuits for milk. The shepherds were giving their dogs
to drink, and made me wait until they had drunk their
fill, thinking no doubt that their dogs were as good as "a
Christian dog," (the ordinary epithet of abuse applied by
Mussulmans to Christians). I had my revenge, for when
I had drank my milk, I took good care to give
them only a fair and exact return of biscuits, which
made them ask for more, but which I refused. Started
again, and did not arrive at Mohammed's village, in the
district of Rujban, till after midnight. It was a most<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-46" id="V1-46"></a>[<a href="./images/1-46.png">46</a>]</span>
wearisome ride. I kept asking Mohammed, "how far
the village was off?" He would say, "Now three
hours;" in two hours after, it was still "three hours;" in
two hours after that, it was still "two hours and a half;"
it was "near" when it was six hours before we arrived;
it was "close by us," three hours before we arrived, &amp;c. &amp;c.
But an Arab will often tell you a place is just under
your nose when it is at a day's journey distant, pointing
to it as if he saw it within a musket-shot. I was highly
exasperated at Mohammed, because we had delayed to
eat anything all day long, upon his representing to me
that we should arrive an hour after sunset. But the
milk acted like a purgative, and was perhaps advantageous.
No people were seen in The Mountains, and
very little cultivation. There were a few modern antiquities,
chiefly the stones of Moorish forts and castles.
Many villages in ruins, destroyed in the late wars. And
Mohammed, like a thoughtless idiot, ridiculed the rude
desolations of his brethren, exulting and calling out to
me to see "the cooking places." Many parts had the
geological features of the Sahel, or hilly country in the
neighbourhood of the city of Algiers. The air was pure
and cool. But though it was calm this day and the
evening, a sudden tempest got up after midnight. I was
lying on the bare ground rolled in a blanket, when the
wind tore it from off me, and I was obliged to retreat to
a hovel. I am told these tempests are frequent in The
Mountains, no doubt arising from the intense heat rarefying
the air.</p>

<p><i>9th.</i>&mdash;Slept the greater part of this day to recover
from the fatigue of the preceding days. Do not suffer
much, and am surprised I do not suffer more. Asked<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-47" id="V1-47"></a>[<a href="./images/1-47.png">47</a>]</span>
Mohammed for the quarter of sheep purchased at Yefran,
and taxed him with stealing it: told him I would
give him no backsheesh on arriving at Ghadames. He
had stolen the meat to make a feast for his friends on his
arrival, and afterwards brought me a piece of my own
meat cooked as his own, but which I refused. This is a
fine illustration of being generous at another person's
expense. In the evening went to see Rujban. There are
seven villages forming the district of Rujban. These consist
of so many mud and stone buildings, but some of the
houses are excavations out of the solid rock, the principal
object being protection from the fiery summer heat, and
the intense winter cold. Many of the houses have a
yard before them, which is walled round, and three or
four are mostly clustered together. Sometimes excavations
are made in a pit or hollow found on high ground,
and then a subterraneous passage leading to them is
excavated from the mountain sides: these are reckoned
very secure. From the heights where I write, there is a
boundless view of the plain and undulating ground which
lie between the Mediterranean and this Atlas chain.
The Arabs call it their sea, and it certainly looks like a
sea from these heights. A marabout sanctuary and
garden at the base of the mountains, is called their port.
There is frequently a freshness rising from the subjected
plain like that of the sea. The camels, they say, are
their ships. There are besides some pretty views in and
over the Atlas valleys, where you overlook the small
scattered oasisian spots of cultivation, with here and
there a palm and little groups of inclosed fig-trees. Then
again, there are heights crowned with olive-woods, as if
The Mountains had put on a black scull-cap. Some of<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-48" id="V1-48"></a>[<a href="./images/1-48.png">48</a>]</span>
the precipices are so profound, as to deserve the epithet
of "horrid." In different parts of these heights are
flights of natural steps, by which they are ascended, and
which seem to have received some finish from Arabian
ingenuity.</p>

<p>In spite of the freshness and coolness of mountain air,
it has been very hot these last two days. On the plains,
the people say the heat is now overpowering.</p>

<p>There is scarcely any natural produce about. A few
sheep and goats, a camel or two, and a few asses, are all
the animals I have seen. The fig-trees produce something,
but I have seen no prickly-pears, which support
many poor families on The Coast, during several months
every year. The olive plantations are the principal
resource of these poor mountaineers, which are also a
sensible relief for the eye on these bare heights. In the
houses there is hardly anything to be got. No pepper,
no onions, no meat killed or sold. No bread can be
obtained for love or money. I laid in a stock of fresh
bread in Tripoli for a fortnight, but my gluttonous
camel driver devoured all in three or four days! There
were no less than fifty twopenny loaves. He was accustomed
to eat in the night, when I was asleep, and used
to threaten to beat Said if he blabbed. I mentioned
the circumstance after, to the Rais of Ghadames, who
observed: "If you had brought a thousand loaves, all
would have been devoured."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this abject poverty, a bullying tax-gatherer,
with half a dozen louting soldiers, have been
up here prowling about, and wresting with violence the
means of supporting life from these miserable beings.
The scenes which I witness are heart-rending, beyond all<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-49" id="V1-49"></a>[<a href="./images/1-49.png">49</a>]</span>
I have heard of Irish misery and rent-distraining bullies.
One man had his camel seized, the only support of his family;
another his bullock; another a few bushels of barley: the
houses were entered, searched, and ransacked; people were
dragged by the throat through the villages, and beaten with
sticks; and all because the poor wretches had no money to
meet the demands of these voracious bailiffs. Poverty is,
indeed, here a crime. One poor old woman had a few bad
unripe figs seized, and came to me, and a group of wretched
villagers, crying out bitterly. One or two men, who
were imagined to have something, though they had nothing,
were held by the throat until they were nearly
suffocated. I cursed over and over again in my heart
the Turks. I was not prepared for such scenes of
cruelty in these remote mountains. We shall find, that
amongst the so-called barbarians of The Desert there was
nothing equal in atrocity to this. What wonder that the
Arab prefers, if he can, to pasture his flocks on savage
and remote wastes to being subjected to these regular
Governments&mdash;of extortion! And yet we, in our ignorance
of what is here going on, are surprised at their
preference. If the people are not ready with their
money, the little barley, their winter's store, is seized, and
they must pay afterwards their usual quotas of money.
Several bags of barley are illegally gotten in this way.
The amount of tax or tribute for the whole district of
Rujban is five or six hundred mahboubs, which is paid in
three instalments, three times a year; but, which though
nothing in amount, is more than all the people are worth
together, for riches and poverty are relative possessions,
if the latter can be possessed. If they can't pay in
money they pay in kind. The Sheikh of the district,<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-50" id="V1-50"></a>[<a href="./images/1-50.png">50</a>]</span>
with the elders, determine how much each man and
family shall pay. This, of course, gives rise to ten thousand
disputes, heart-burnings, and eternal wranglings
amongst themselves. The Arabs, on these occasions,
however silent and sulky they may be on others, show
that they have the gift of speech, as well as Frenchmen
and Italians. Then, indeed, God's thunder can't be
heard. Marabouts do not pay these taxes. This is a
privilege of religion, which successfully exerts itself
against the oppressive arm of the civil power. Such
privilege has been enjoyed in all ages and countries.
My camel-driver is a Marabout, and is consequently
exempt. I rallied him upon his privilege, and he replied:
"The villains are afraid to come here; see my
flag-staff and green flag, they dare not come over my
threshold&mdash;God would strike them down!" It is impossible
to tell how much of the five hundred mahboubs gets
into the treasury of Government, but, I am told, a good
portion gets into the pockets of the officials. The whole
administration of The Mountains, and the Saharan oases
of Tripoli, is conducted on the same principles of finance
and extortion.</p>

<p>I am lodged in the house of my camel-driver. The
women show the greatest curiosity to see me, and declare
that I am more beautiful (<i>bahea</i>) than they. They wonderingly
admire everything I have. The greater part of
these women never left their mountain-homes&mdash;never saw
a Christian or European before&mdash;and this is the reason
of their surprise at my appearance. The children, of
course, are equally astonished, but are too frightened to
reflect steadily on an European. Both the women and
men say it is <i>maktoub</i>, ("predestination") which has<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-51" id="V1-51"></a>[<a href="./images/1-51.png">51</a>]</span>
brought me amongst them, and they are right. These
poor people are very civil to me. In my quality of
tabeeb they consult me. The prevailing disease is sore
eyes. Two children were brought to me, a girl with a
dropsy of a year's standing, and a boy with only one
testiculum, for neither of which did I prescribe. The
employment of the men is camel-driving between Tripoli
and Ghadames. Agriculture, there is scarcely any. The
women weave barracans or holees for their husbands,
themselves, and children, and for sale. They are mostly
dirty, and ill-clothed. The men have but a single barracan
to cover them, one or two may have a shirt; the
children are nearly naked; and the women wear a woollen
frock, charms round their necks, armlets, and anclets,
sometimes throwing a slight barracan or sefsar round their
heads and shoulders. I observed, however, that often
women wear great leather boots, made of red leather or
camel's skin. None of them were pretty, but some were
fine-looking, with aquiline noses, and rolling about their
large, black, gazelle-like eyes.</p>

<p><i>10th.</i>&mdash;Spent the day in writing notes. Expect to
remain three more days. I am, however, comfortably
sheltered from the heat, which has been to-day excessive.
Mohammed, my camel-driver, is useful to me as a writer
of Arabic, giving me the names of places in Arabic.
But he knows nothing of Arabic grammar, and writes
very poorly, like most of these Marabouts, although he
passes for being a very learned man. He purchased
some old dirty leaves of an Arabic book, and exhibited
them to the people as sacred works. The Sheikhs of
Rujban and all the great people of the villages came to
stare at them. They were shocked at my presumption<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-52" id="V1-52"></a>[<a href="./images/1-52.png">52</a>]</span>
in wishing to handle these sacred leaves, which were a
portion of a commentary on the Koran. My Marabout
is the Katab, or writer of the village, there being only
another who can write here besides himself, and who
writes very badly. Mohammed, though a saint and a
writer, is an enormous hog, and dishonest, when he can
be so with safety. He has begun badly, but may turn
out better. Said is not of much use yet; he is very
stupid, but not malicious. I must make the best of
both, and of every body and everything in my present
circumstances, conciliating always wherever I can, and
passing by all offences. If I can't do this, I may go
back. I cannot finish these trifling memoranda to-day,
without expressing my thankfulness to a good Providence,
that I enjoy good health and spirits up to this
time, and there is every appearance of my arriving safely
in Ghadames. "All is from God!" (<i>Men &acirc;nd Allah
El-koul</i>, as the people say.)</p>

<p><i>11th.</i>&mdash;Yesterday evening conversed with the Arab
villagers, and asked them if the soldiers of the Government
were gone, <i>i. e.</i>, the collectors of the tribute.
They replied, "Yes, thank God, and may they never
return! The curse of God upon them!" They then
asked me, if the people were treated so by our Government.
I observed to them, "Not always. But that
sometimes the British Government sorely oppressed the
people, as all the Governments of Europe; and I was
often tempted to think that there were only two classes
of people in the world, the oppressing and the oppressed,
(<i>i. e.</i>, the eaters and the eaten)." To which latter remark
they all answered with a loud "Amen," and swore
it was the truth. They then asked me, "If the English<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-53" id="V1-53"></a>[<a href="./images/1-53.png">53</a>]</span>
were coming to Tripoli?" I told them, "No," for the
English had now more countries than they knew what to
do with. Surprised at this remark, they continued,
"What are the French vessels doing at Tripoli?"
(There were then a French steamer and a brig at this
time.) I told them to keep away the Turks from
attacking Tunis. They were anxious to know if the
French would come to Tripoli. I answered, I thought
not, as they had enough of Algeria. "We hope (<i>en
shallah</i>,)" said they, "the English are our friends." I
replied they were, but, being friends of the Sultan of
Constantinople, they would not take possession of Tripoli.
The fact was, these poor people were just smarting
under the oppressive acts of the Turkish tax-gatherers,
and they would then have sold their country
to the first comer for an old song, were the buyer Christian,
Jew, or Pagan. But I have always found the
Arabs fond of talking of politics; it seems instinctive in
their character; and it is astonishing how much policy
is always going on amongst their tribes, and how intricate
are the various negotiations of the Sheikhs. I
asked them "If they had any arms?" To which they
replied, "No, none whatever; the Turks have taken
them all away." And so these once formidable mountaineers
have not only lost all spirit and courage, but
have not even arms to defend themselves against the
most petty annoyances. Robberies of the small kind
are frequent about the neighbourhood, and the people
are often obliged to gather their figs before they are
ripe, lest they should be stolen. At other times they
display great impatience of the seasons, and gather the
fruit before ripe. Those who steal provisions are poor<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-54" id="V1-54"></a>[<a href="./images/1-54.png">54</a>]</span>
famished devils, having nothing to eat. There is no
poor-law here. It is simply a question of theft or
starvation to death. This is the alternative of Arab
life in many parts of these mountains.</p>

<p>This morning received a visit from the Sheikh of
Rujban, Bel Kasem by name<a name="FNa_1-15" id="FNa_1-15"></a><a href="#FoN_1-15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>, and his head-servant, or
factotum. I made them the best coffee I could, putting
into it plenty of sugar. The Arabs are curious people;
they like things either very bitter or very sweet. Their
eyes sparkled with satisfaction; they had never tasted
coffee before like it, and were rejoiced&mdash;"Tripoli always
belongs to the English!" Speaking of the Marabouts,
and alluding to my Mohammed, the Sheikh said,
"These fellows pray God and rob men." "Mohammed,"
he added, "is a rogue, he pays nothing, and I am
obliged to eat up all the people to make up the amount
for the Bashaw." It is curious to observe everywhere
this eternal contest between the civil and spiritual power.
To pacify him, I told him Christian priests were many
of them as bad as Marabouts (and which is quite within
the mark). The Sheikh and his men had very white
teeth. I observe nearly all the Arab men and women,
as well as the negroes, to have extremely white teeth.
This has never been medically accounted for; I believe
it arises from the simplicity of the food they eat.
Some Tunisian Arabs have reported that large bodies
of troops are being concentrated at the Isle of Jerbah,
in expectation of the Turks. The trading Arabs are
the gazettes of North Africa.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-55" id="V1-55"></a>[<a href="./images/1-55.png">55</a>]</span></p>
<p>Said's feet are very sore, arising from Mohammed
refusing to allow him to ride. I was obliged to tell him,
at last, that, unless he permitted him to ride, Said
should not help him to load the camels. This had some
effect, and he allowed Said to ride an hour or two before
reaching here. This Marabout is, indeed, a cruel,
selfish fellow. He also pretends to be very jealous, and
will not allow any person, much less a Christian, to see
his wife. He won't allow me to present her a cup of
coffee. But I found out the reason; the rascal wished to
carry it himself, and drink half of it on the way. Afterwards
his wife told me herself the reason. An indiscreet
conjugal disclosure this: but such is the character of
the man.</p>

<p>An old blind man is calling on me. He tells me his
country is my country, and his people my brothers and
sisters. He prays God to bless me and preserve me.
How soft and gentle&mdash;how full of good-will and patience&mdash;are
the manners of the blind in all countries! Full
fed flesh and the prosperous are proud and cruel, those
stricken with infirmity and misery show the milk of
human kindness. This poor old gentleman prays all the
day long. Prayer is his daily bread. The Arabs ask
me if Said is my slave. I tell them the English have no
slaves, and that it is against their religion, but that some
other Christian nations have slaves. They are greatly
astonished that slavery is not permitted amongst us.
The women of the village continue to visit me as an
object of curiosity. They never saw a Christian before.
They are always declaring me "bahea," handsome, of
which compliment I am, indeed, very sensible.</p>

<p>This evening, however, the women of our two or three<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-56" id="V1-56"></a>[<a href="./images/1-56.png">56</a>]</span>
huts, and their neighbours, played me an indecent trick,
with, of course, a mercenary object. Although the Barbary
dance is rare amongst the Arab women, they can
have recourse to it at times to suit their objects. The
men were gone to bring the camels, and the women sent
Said after them on some frivolous message. Four of the
women now came into my apartment, and taking hold
of hands, formed a circle round me. They then began
dancing, or rather making certain indecent motions of
the body, known to travellers in North Africa. At once
nearly smothered and overpowered, I could scarcely get
out of the circle, and pushed them back with great
difficulty. At this they were astonished, and wondered
all men, Christians and Mussulmans, did not like such
delicate condescension on their part. "Don't you like it,
infidel?" they cried, and retreated from my room. I now
saw their object. They began begging for money vehemently,
saying, "Pay, pay, every body pays for this."
Nothing they got from me; and the wife of the Marabout
came afterwards, imploring me to say nothing to her
husband. It is thus these rude women will act for
money, as many who are better taught, in the streets of
London. But acts of indelicacy are nevertheless very
rare amongst the mountain tribes. I have seen Arab
women at other occasions, on a cold day, standing
athwart a smoking fire, with all the smoke ascending
under their clothes. This may be expected, and is characteristic
of the filthy habits of these wretched mountaineers.
But cases of adultery are unknown amongst
these simple people.</p>

<p><i>12th.</i>&mdash;A beautiful Arab girl, a perfect mountain
gazelle, came with her mother to consult me about her<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-57" id="V1-57"></a>[<a href="./images/1-57.png">57</a>]</span>
eyes, being near-sighted. Recommended her to apply
to Dr. Dickson, if she ever went to Tripoli; and wrote
her a note to him. Many other people came for medicines.
Went to see an old man whose eyes were bad
with ophthalmia. I gave him some solution to wash his
eyes, and he gave me in turn a jar of new milk. Something
was said about olive-oil, and I asked where we could get
some. They said there was none in Rujban. The lady
of my host thinking me incredulous, pulled her gray
grisly hair, and exhibited its crispness and dryness,
observing, "See, where's the oil?" Of course such an
argument was conclusive that they had no oil in the
house.</p>

<p>The villagers, in this season, do absolutely nothing,
unless it be sleep all day long. The fact is, it is awfully
hot, from early morn to evening late, and they have little
to do. All that they have to do, many of them do with
apparent dispatch. At the dawn of day the wind is so
strong, one cannot enjoy an hour of the morning's freshness;
and, in the evening, the sultry ghiblee is equally
disagreeable. I scarcely go out of my room the whole
day. Begin to recover my Arabic. Many times I have
begun and re-begun this difficult language. But there is
no remedy. I must work, and work brings some
pleasure, at least destroys ennui and kills time. However
little time we have, we wish it less.</p>

<p>The Arabs ask me, "Why the Christian priests have
no wives?" The Mohammedans and Catholics go to
extremes in their ideas of separating or connecting
women with religion and sanctity. The Mohammedans
think a saint or marabout cannot have too many women<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-58" id="V1-58"></a>[<a href="./images/1-58.png">58</a>]</span>
or wives, which, they say, assist their devotion&mdash;a sentiment
which they pretend to have received from Mahomet
himself by tradition. The fact is, the prophet was very
fond of women. The Catholics would seem to think a
priest better with absolutely no wife. This is a mere
struggle between sensuality and asceticism. There is no
love or affection in it. I showed Mohammed an empty
bottle. He took a piece of paper and wrote: "The
bottle is empty of wine, God fill it again." Such is Arab
marabout literature.</p>

<p><i>13th.</i>&mdash;Elhamdullah! The wind has changed, the
furnace breath of the ghiblee is gone out! We have
now a pleasant breeze from N.W., the bahree, as the
Arabs call it. We can now go out any time; before we
were prisoners the live-long day. Mohammed, who pretends
to all sciences, says: "There are three modes of
cure&mdash;"1st, Blood-letting; "2nd, Fire and burning;
"3rd, The word of God."</p>

<p>He made this observation in applying verses of the
Koran to the eyes of his wife's sister, which he said
were more efficacious than all my physic. Some of these
bits of paper, with the name of God written on them,
were steeped in water and swallowed by the patient.
This superstition of swallowing bits of paper, with the
name of God and verses of the Koran written on them,
as well as the water in which the paper is steeped, is
prevalent as an infallible remedy in all Mahometan
Africa. Marabouts are all powerful in The Mountains;
and a woman, pointing to her child, said to me:&mdash;"That
boy is the child of a Marabout. I never allow
another man to sleep with me." Nevertheless, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-59" id="V1-59"></a>[<a href="./images/1-59.png">59</a>]</span>
women still display intense curiosity in seeing "The
Christian," and will declare, "By G&mdash;d, you are beautiful,
more handsome than our men." They admire the
most trifling thing I have, and add, "God alone brought
you amongst us." Their language, though indelicate to
us, is not so to them. It is the undisguised speech of a
rude people.</p>

<p>Went this morning to see El-Beer, or "the well,"
the real fountain of life in these countries. Was
much pleased with the visit; and found it at the
bottom of a deep ravine, bubbling out from beneath
the shade of palms and olives, amidst wild scenery of
rugged steeps and hanging rocks. There are indeed,
four springs, but all apparently from the same
source. They are not deep, and have near them troughs
for watering sheep, goats, cattle, and camels. These
wells furnish water for two mountain districts. The
water is of the purest quality, clear as crystal, aye, clear
as&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Siloa's brook that flow'd</span>
<span class="i0">Fast by the oracle of God."</span>
</div></div>

<p>The road to them is very difficult, over rattling, rumbling
stones, and rocks, and precipices, and it is hard
work for the poor women who fetch the water, for the
wells are distant nearly three miles from our village.</p>

<p>The Sheikh came to my Mohammed, asking him to
write to Tripoli, to collect the money due to the Bashaw
from certain people of this country, who are now working
in that city. They look sharp after these poor
wretches. Amuse myself with washing my handkerchiefs
and towels, and mending my clothes. I also
always cook and do as much for myself as I possibly can.<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-60" id="V1-60"></a>[<a href="./images/1-60.png">60</a>]</span>
Besides doing things as I like, it amuses me. Bought
another skin-bag for water, and shall now distribute the
three amongst us, and each shall drink his own water
during the four days of our route, where no water is to
be found. This will prevent wrangling on the way, and
make each person more careful of this grand element of
life in The Desert. Mohammed put a little oil in the
skin before filling it, to prevent it from cracking. This
gives the water an oily taste for weeks afterwards, but
we get used to it, and are glad of water with any
taste.</p>

<p>His Excellency the Sheikh got very facetious to-day.
He offered to sell me his authority, his Sheikhdom, and
retire from affairs. I bid one thousand dollars for the
concern. "No, no," said he, "I'll take ten thousand
dollars, nothing less." Then, getting very familiar, he
added, "Now, you and I are equal, you're Consul and
I'm Sheikh&mdash;you're the son of your Sultan, and I'm a
commander under the Sultan of Stamboul." The report
of my being a Consul of a remote oasis of The Sahara
was just as good to me on the present occasion as if I
had Her Majesty's commission for the Consular Affairs of
all North Africa. Who will say, then, there is nothing
in a name? A tourist in Africa should always take
advantage of these little rumours, provided they are
innocent. But the traveller more frequently has to encounter
rumours to his disadvantage. Many visitors,
men, women, and children&mdash;some brought milk, others
figs and soap. Soap is considered a luxury in all the
interior cities, and people will beg soap though never
use it, but keep it as a sort of treasure. Fig and olive
trees abound in the mountains, but for want of rain<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-61" id="V1-61"></a>[<a href="./images/1-61.png">61</a>]</span>
have produced nothing this year. So of most other
vegetables products. Goats only are in abundance, of
animals. The ordinary food of the people is bazeen, a
sort of boiled flour pudding, with a little high-seasoned
herbal sauce, and sometimes a little oil or mutton fat
poured on. It is generally made of barley-meal, but
sometimes flour. This is the supper and principal meal
of the day. As a breakfast, a little milk is drank, or a
few dates with a bit of bread is eaten. The rule of
these mountaineers is, indeed, not to eat meat, though
some of them have flocks of sheep.</p>

<p><i>14th.</i>&mdash;His Excellency the Sheikh roused me from my
bed this morning. He said he could not sleep, and
therefore I ought not to sleep. According to his Excellency,
Rujban contains 500 souls, all in misery and
starvation. "The country is <i>batel</i> (good for nothing),"
he says. It is certain the greater part of the people
have not enough to eat, or half the quantity of what
is considered ordinarily sufficient. In the neighbouring
districts, S.W., there are 1,500 souls. Ahmed Bashaw
destroyed the greater part of the inhabitants of these
mountains, and disarmed the rest, leaving not a single
matchlock amongst them. Such are the Turkish ideas
of mountain rule&mdash;absolute submission or extermination!</p>

<p>This morning is cool and temperate. Every day continue
to administer solution for ophthalmia, and even
those whose eyes are quite well, will have a drop of it
put on their eyes. They say it will prevent them, after
I am gone, from having the malady. Everybody begs a
bit of sugar, a little bread, a scrap of paper, a something
from the Christian. Content all as well as I can.</p>

<p>This evening saw, for the first time "the playing with<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-62" id="V1-62"></a>[<a href="./images/1-62.png">62</a>]</span>
the head," which is performed by females. This was
done by a young girl. After baring her head and unbinding
her hair, throwing her long dark tresses in
dishevelled confusion, she knelt down and began moving
her chest and head in various attitudes, her whole soul
being apparently in the motion. Part of her hair she
held fast in her teeth, as if modestly to cover her face,
the rest flew wildly about with the agitation of her head
and chest, and all to the tune or time of two pieces of
stick, one beating on the other, by the woman upon whose
knees she leaned with her hands. The motion was
really graceful, though wild and dervish-like, but there
was nothing lascivious in it, like the dancing of the
Moors, nor could it well be, the upper part of the body
only was in agitation, being literally "the playing with
the head." I never saw this before or again in North
Africa. I gave the young lady twenty paras, the first
time she had so large a sum in her life. Received a
present of leghma from the Sheikh, very acrid and
intoxicating. The women admire much my straw hat,
made of fine Leghorn plat, and wonder how it is done.
None of the inhabitants but our Marabout read and
write. Portions of the Koran, however, are committed
to memory; and one day an old blind man repeated
several chapters of the Koran for my especial edification.
He did it as a protest of zeal against my infidelity before
the people, but I took care not to show that I was
aware of the object. The men pray now and then, the
women never, that I could see, and never think of religion
beyond ascribing all things, good and bad, to God.
Indeed, all classes in these mountains think the sum of
religion consists simply in ascribing all matters, how great<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-63" id="V1-63"></a>[<a href="./images/1-63.png">63</a>]</span>
or how small, how evil how good soever, to the Divine
Being. When they have done this, they think they have
performed an act of piety and mercy. At my request,
Mohammed made Said a pair of camel-driver's shoes, or
sandals, to save his best. The plan is primitive enough.
They get a piece of dried camel's hide, and cut it into
the shape of the sole of the foot. Then they cut two
thongs from the same hide. Holes are now bored
through the soles, a knot is made at the end of the
thongs, and they are pulled through the holes. The
whole is then rubbed over with oil; the hairy side of
the hide is fitted next to the foot, and the thongs are
bound round the ancles. These sandals serve admirably
well their purpose; some are made of double soles.
But for the especial benefit of our cordwainers, I may
mention, the African shoe has no heel to the sole.</p>

<p><i>15th.</i>&mdash;His Excellency the Sheikh, and his factotum,
or shadow, took coffee again with me this morning. A
cup of coffee is a rare treat in Rujban. The Shadow of
his Excellency brought me a few bad Fezzan dates, from
which oases The Mountains are mostly supplied. Dates
are not cultivated in The Mountains. The palm requires
a low and flat sandy soil. The climate is not of so much
consequence as the soil. Jerbah, and the Karkenahs,
islands in the Mediterranean, produce as fine dates as the
most favoured oasis of The Sahara. The Sheikh tells me
there are thirty negro slaves in his district. One would
wonder how the people could keep slaves when they can
scarcely keep themselves. His Excellency is very sulky.
He threatens to resign his Sheikhdom. The poor Sheikh
is the dirtiest, unhappiest mortal of all his people. He
is without wife, family or friend; he is without a rag<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-64" id="V1-64"></a>[<a href="./images/1-64.png">64</a>]</span>
to cover himself, except a filthy blanket. He houses
in a little dirty cabin. In looks he is a hard strong-featured
man, and large of limb. I asked his Excellency
what he got by his Sheikhdom, to plague him.
He growled, "<i>Shayen</i> (nothing)." "Why don't you resign?"
I continued. "I can't; all my ancestors, from
the time of Sidi Ibraim, and our lord Mahomet, were
Sheikhs. We're one blood. I shall dishonour them:" he
returned. The principle of aristocracy is irradicably
bound up in the Arabian social economy. The levelling
and co-operative system has no place here. The Sheikh's
factotum is a noisy, roguish-looking Arab, with several
bullet-marks about him received in the late wars. As he
does all his master's dirty work, he is universally detested.
Master and man swear the country is ruined.
There certainly is nothing in these villages to render life
tolerable. No rustic plays; no moon-lit dance to the
sound of the rude calabash drum and squeaking pipe; no
cheerful family circle&mdash;all is poverty and loneliness!
Such a life is really not worth living. To make wretchedness
still more wretched, for three years there has
been no rain in these mountains. God's power and
man's cruelty press sorely upon these miserable people.</p>

<p>The curiosity of the villagers begins to abate, or my
Mohammed refuses them admission into his house to see
me. He pretends to be honest in his opinion of his
countrymen. He says: "The Arabs are all dogs
(<i>kelab</i>)." They certainly have most begging propensities.
And Mohammed adds, that when they have sufficient
they will still beg, being born beggars. But, alas! these
poor people, I am sure, never know now what it is to
have enough. Yesterday some audacious thief stole the<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-65" id="V1-65"></a>[<a href="./images/1-65.png">65</a>]</span>
Sheikh's leghma. His factotum is foaming with rage,
but the Sheikh laughed heartily at the impudence of the
thief. His Excellency is accustomed to send me some
every morning. I shall here relate a case or trait of
selfishness amongst Arab women. I gave to the wife of
the Marabout half a bottle of solution for washing her
eyes should she be attacked with ophthalmia. Her
sister-in-law, living next door, was laid up in a dark
room with a dreadful ophthalmia. She sent her husband
to beg a little of the solution. The Marabout's wife
first denied that she had any, and then that she could
find it. When I came from my walk, I scolded her
soundly and gave the poor sufferer some solution.</p>

<p>The Marabout seeing my little stock of oil, burst forth
with a violent panegyric on olive oil, as he dipped his
fingers into it and licked them, not much to my satisfaction:&mdash;"Oil
is my life! Without oil I droop, and am
out of life; with oil, I raise my head and am a man,
and my family (wife) feels I am a man. Oil is my rum&mdash;oil
is better than meat." So continued Mohammed,
tossing up his head and smacking his lips. I have no
doubt there is great strength in olive oil. An Arab will
live three months on barley-meal paste dipped in olive
oil. Arabs will drink oil as we drink wine.</p>

<p><i>16th.</i>&mdash;This morning we leave for Ghadames. What
is remarkable, nearly all the Mountaineers offered me
their services, and were willing to leave their native
homes, and go with me any where or everywhere. I
hardly observed a spark of fanaticism in them, so far as
accompanying me was concerned. They were all actuated
with the common and universal feeling, to obtain
something to live withal in this poor world.<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-66" id="V1-66"></a>[<a href="./images/1-66.png">66</a>]</span></p>

<p>I have endeavoured to give some minuti&aelig; of Arab
mountain life. It will be seen to be not very stirring or
agreeable, and there is certainly no romance in it, but,
such as it is, I offer it to the reader, and he must make
the best of the information. Life is life under any and
all forms.</p>

<p>From Tripoli to The Mountains our route was southwest,
so that we were not so far from the coast as at first
might be imagined, from the number of days' journey,
and we were still within the influence of some cool sea
breezes, for any point almost between west and northeast,
brought reviving life to The Mountains, in this
terrible season of heat.</p>

<p>My journey seemed now to begin again, I felt a sickening
regret, even in leaving my new Arab acquaintances.
But the oppression which ground down to the dust these
poor people filled my mind with the horror of despotic
government. I was glad to get away from its victims,
and from under the sphere of its influence, and plunge
into the wild wastes of The Sahara, where I could breathe
more freely. I must relate one other anecdote illustrating
this oppression. A poor man sold me a peck of
barley. The myrmidons of power, hearing of the sale,
immediately went to him, and he refusing to give them
the money, they got hold of his throat and nearly strangled
him. To make them desist, I paid them also the
value of the barley. Several of the poor people ran out
after me when I mounted the camel, and amongst them
many women and children, all crying out "<i>Bes-slamah,
bes-slamah</i>," (Good-bye, good-bye). We now entered
upon the most difficult, and the most critical part of our
route in this season, and I commended myself and the
people again to Eternal Providence.<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-67" id="V1-67"></a>[<a href="./images/1-67.png">67</a>]</span></p>

<p><i>20th.</i>&mdash;Seenawan. I find it impossible to write daily
in this part of the route.</p>

<p>I have seen lately in the newspapers and geographical
journals, that a Frenchman is going to traverse Africa
from west to east, and that he is to make hourly observations
with scientific instruments. I think the parties who
write such paragraphs must be either madmen, or grossly
and unpardonably ignorant of the nature of African
travelling. If a traveller is in his sober senses, half the
time he is <i>en route</i>, he is a happy man. But to proceed.</p>

<p>Our first object was to find the rendezvous of the ghafalah.
I said to Mohammed: "Are you sure the ghafalah
is on the march to-day?" "The ghafalah is like the
sun," he replied, "every body knows it will move to-day."
About four hours after looking over the undulating
ground, I thought I saw at about six miles distant
some black spots moving, and turning to Mohammed, I
said, "What's that?" He exclaimed, "The camels! the
camels! I told you I was right, and don't you see I
have struck into the right path?" I was glad to hear
this, for I was not yet sufficiently broken in to desert
travelling to be wandering about as we were in search of
moving parties of the ghafalah. An hour after I took off
the shade from my eyes, for I had still a slight ophthalmia,
and looking round, I found we were in the midst of
detached parties of the ghafalah, widely apart, but all hurrying
in one direction. We were not near enough (indeed
some miles off) to have any conversation with them.
By noon we had all rendezvoused upon a pleasant plateau
of The Mountains. The merchants welcomed my
return, and asked me what I had been doing. I said,<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-68" id="V1-68"></a>[<a href="./images/1-68.png">68</a>]</span>
"We have delayed too long." They smiled:&mdash;"Oh, you
don't understand; you see we have one day for buying
oil, another day for barley, another for skins, another for
doing nothing," &amp;c. It appeared to me a bungling way
of doing business. But some of them had been obliged
to go a day's journey to purchase a few things. The
ghafalah had, in fact, been scattered all over The Mountains.
A few never left Yefran. This was my first
taste of delay in Saharan travel.</p>

<p>We began our four days' journey in the evening, and
continued all night up to two hours before sunrise. The
camels then rested but were not unpacked. All the
people now got a few winks of sleep. At dawn we
started again, and halted for the day after two hours and
a half of marching. In the afternoon, about half-past
four, we then resumed our march, and in this manner
we continued for the four days. Our pace was upon an
average three miles per hour, sometimes two and a half,
and sometimes three and a half. On looking at the
camel you think it goes slow, but when you look at the
driver, you observe that he is often kept up to a very
good walking pace. Our camels were five days without
drinking, for they drank the morning before we left.</p>

<p>I was once going to write, "the Arabs pack their
camels as badly as possible; make their journeys as long
as possible; travel as much in the sun as possible<a name="FNa_1-16" id="FNa_1-16"></a><a href="#FoN_1-16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>;" but
these last four days have convinced me that, under the
guidance of a good Arab chief, they know what they are
about, and can do things with order and dispatch.</p>

<p>I don't know how it was, but it came into my head
that, on leaving The Mountains, and proceeding south,<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-69" id="V1-69"></a>[<a href="./images/1-69.png">69</a>]</span>
we should soon descend again, as if we were to cross
some mighty ridge or series of ridges of the Atlas.
Every moment I expected to descend into valleys or
plains, corresponding to the country which lies between
Tripoli and The Mountains. Getting impatient, after
nearly a day's march, I asked for the plains. The
people turned upon me with surprise, and said:&mdash;"<i>Lel
Ghadames, koul hathe souwa, souwa</i>, All like this to Gadmes."
I found, indeed, that, after getting fairly into
The Mountains, and proceeding south, you first entered
upon a deep undulating country, with here and there a
profound ravine, then a pretty verdant inclosed plateau,
and then a bare towering height, all which <i>accidented</i>
country dissolved at last into an immeasurable plain.
Proceeding south, however, we found a new species of
mountains began to raise their long, lone, dull, dreary
naked forms; and, asking Mohammed what they were,
he replied correctly enough:&mdash;"These are <i>Gibel Sahara</i>,
(Saharan Mountains)." The plateaus and undulating
ground were in places covered with loose stones, with
sand and sand-hills scattered or heaped about. Then
these stones and sand were partly covered at this season
with sun-dried and sun-burnt herbage, mostly very
coarse, with here and there a few bushes and shrubs.
Many also were the dried beds of rivers, and there were
still wider and profounder depressions of land than these
waterless wadys. But all is now burnt, scorched, dried
up, and the nakedness of the Saharan ridges is responded
to with a hideous barrenness from the intervening plains
and valleys. Not a single living creature was visible or
moving; not a wild or tame animal, not a bird nor an
insect, if we except a tiny lizard, which seems to live as<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-70" id="V1-70"></a>[<a href="./images/1-70.png">70</a>]</span>
a salamander in heat and flames, now and then crossing
our path at the camel's foot, and a few flies, which follow
the ghafalah, but have no home or habitation in The
Dried-up Waste. Nor was there a sound, nor a voice,
or a cry, or the faintest murmur in The Desert, save the
heavy dull tramp of our caravan: all else was the silence
of death! However, my Marabout tells me, in the winter
the whole scene is changed. "There is then," he
says, "herbage, rain, birds, gazelles, and all things." It
is certain that within nine hours' ride from Rujban we
passed the stubble of two or three patches of barley,
which had been rescued from the dominion of The
Desert.</p>

<p>As to myself, personally, in this part of the route, I
have suffered most from want of sleep. In the day-time
it was too hot to sleep, and in the night I was on
the back of the camel, where, of course, for the present,
I could not be expected to sleep, though many of the
Arabs, nay, merchants slept. I should say all slept on
the camel as soundly as in a bed. So that what I saved
of suffering from the heat of day-travelling, I lost in want
of sleep by night-travelling. Poor human brute! I thought
of the fable of the ass and his winter and summer advantages
and disadvantages. The hottest day was yesterday,
last of the four, when we encamped in a dry bed of a
river. I shall never forget that day, forget what I may
else! I was first on the point of being suffocated, and
seemed at my last gasp. I began to think that the predictions
of my <i>friends</i> in Tripoli were about to be
verified. I was to succumb to make them prophets! In
addition to this my deep distress, I felt the wound of
pride. I got some tea made, I can't tell how, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-71" id="V1-71"></a>[<a href="./images/1-71.png">71</a>]</span>
poured some brandy into it. This I drank, and from a
fever of delirium found myself conscious again, and
swimming in a bath of perspiration. The crisis was
now passed, and I was to see Ghadames and Ghat, and
return to my fatherland. So fate&mdash;rather Providence&mdash;would
have it. Every day, until I reached Ghadames,
there was a sort of point of halting between life and
suffocation or death in my poor frame, when the European
nature struggled boldly and successfully with the
African sun, and all his accumulated force darting down
fires and flames upon my devoted head. After this
point or crisis was past, I always found myself much
better. It is strange that my head never ached, nor was
in any way affected during the whole route, except in
the one day mentioned. Some and all have vainly invoked
sleep upon a bed, in the time of darkness and
cold, but those who call for the god in the African
Desert, in midday of the hottest season of the year&mdash;and
to the last moment of starting with a long, long
night of travel before them&mdash;as they lay rolling on the
burning sand, and he disdains to shed his dull influence
over the eyelid, know, indeed, something of this kind of
human suffering, and how dreadfully long and dreary
were those nights! What signified the sight of the
ten thousand orbs moving in silent mystic dance, and
dressed out in soft bright fires, over the poor traveller's
head! Alas! it was a mockery of his woes.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Four
days and four nights were thus passed, without
four hours of sleep. I often wonder if I could go
through this again. I had an additional suffering of
the eyes. I never took the veil from my face from
sunrise to sunset, for had I done so, I should have had<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-72" id="V1-72"></a>[<a href="./images/1-72.png">72</a>]</span>
the hot sand immediately into them. We had ghiblee or
simoon every day. But, thanks to Heaven, now ends
the greatest of my sufferings from heat.</p>

<p>We were escorted by sixty Arab troops on foot, like
those who escorted us from Tripoli to The Mountains.
The Pasha mostly chooses them from districts through
which we pass, and in this way secures a guard well
acquainted with the route. But how odd, before the
Turks, in the good old days of The Bashaws, these very
Arabs were the banditti of the route. A Ghadames
merchant said to me one day, "Y&acirc;kob<a name="FNa_1-17" id="FNa_1-17"></a><a href="#FoN_1-17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>, see these fellows;
formerly all were villanous <i>Sbandout</i> (banditti)."
The captain of this escort, Sheikh Omer, who will conduct
us to Ghadames, was charged by the Commandant
of The Mountains, that his men should not be allowed to
take water, or anything else by force, "bel kouwee," as
the merchants said. The Sheikh was a civil fellow, and
found it his interest to cultivate my acquaintance. Every
morning I invited him to take coffee and tea in my tent,
and he never forgot to come. In acknowledgment, he
sent me some liquid butter, which was not excessively
bad. The food of the Arabs, and the poorer sort of the
merchants, for this journey was, as written by my
Mohammed, &#8238;&#1587;&#1615;&#1608;&#1616;&#1610;&#1602;&#1614; &#1586;&#1615;&#1605;&#1616;&#1610;&#1578;&#1607;&#8236; ("Souweekah-Zameetah," that
is, two names); but commonly called Zameetah, which is
nothing more than barley or wheat burnt or malted, then
ground, and afterwards made into paste. On this is
sometimes poured a little oil or fat; but many cannot
afford this luxury, and must content themselves with a
little water to make up the meal into paste. I may<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-73" id="V1-73"></a>[<a href="./images/1-73.png">73</a>]</span>
safely affirm, there was not a bit of meat eaten, or a
drop of tea or coffee drunk, in the whole caravan of
merchants, with 200 camels, including, with the Arabs,
some 150 persons, during the last four days, except
what was eaten and drunk in my tent. I myself had
only a little bit of fowl. The Sheikh <i>Shabanee</i>
(Makouran) as the Arabs call him, was the most civil
to me. His portion of the camels is about forty, and
he seems a most respectable old gentleman. He has
two sons with him. He gave me last night a guzzle of
cool water, a large brass pan full, of the size of a warming-pan,
which I drank off in an instant, and found it
more like nectar, than our earthy animalcul&aelig; water;
it was so deliciously cool and sweet. Valuable, indeed,
becomes a thing of commonest use, from its scarcity.
The old Sheikh has a donkey with him to carry his
drinking-water. The skins keep the water cool even in
the hottest part of the day, whilst some which I had in
bottles became quite hot. I shall here relate an ingenious
stratagem, which I recommend to all African travellers.
On leaving The Mountains we had three skins of
water, one for each. But first, one of the skins cracked,
and we lost a good deal of water, before it could be
mended. Then Mohammed, the chief thief, was accustomed
to drink large draughts when neither myself nor
Said was present. This we learnt from the rest of the
caravan. Said, himself, poor fellow, as soon as Mohammed
had turned his back, was either to beg me to
give him extra water, or help himself. Sometimes I
chided him, at others I gave him water, or was too
much exhausted to see what he was about. Then Said
would help his friends amongst the Arabs now and<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-74" id="V1-74"></a>[<a href="./images/1-74.png">74</a>]</span>
then, and sometimes the Arabs helped themselves, by
going behind me, and sucking from the neck of the skin
whilst I was riding. To avoid this, Mr. Gagliuffi told
me he always put the neck of the skin-bag before and
not behind, so that it was impossible for a person to
drink, and at the same time to walk backwards with
the camel going forwards, or at any rate to do so
without being seen. Then, finally, there was the
terrible action of the sun on the water, often reducing
it by a fifth, and sometimes a third, of our supply. But
the consequence of all this was, our three bags were
empty before we arrived at Seenawan, and the little
water which had remained, the third day, was so shaken
in the skins, all being oiled, that for me it was not drinkable.
Now for the stratagem. Apprehending this waste
of water, I got twelve pint bottles filled with water at
Tripoli, which were packed away as wine and spirits,
neither Mohammed or Said suspecting the contrary.
Accordingly I quietly despatched my couple of bottles
of <i>acqua pura</i> per day, as the London lady drinkers
are said to take their sly drops from the far corner of
the cupboard, without the least suspicion of my fellow
travellers. I overheard once, Mohammed speaking of
me to Said: "By G&mdash;d! these Christians, what lots of
rum they drink: that's the reason, Said, the sun does
not kill him&mdash;he'll never die. These Christians, Said,
are the same as the d&aelig;mons; they know everything, but
God will punish them at last&mdash;if not, there's no God,
or Prophet of God." I took no notice, but when we got
to Ghadames, I took the remaining bottle, and asked him
to drink. He jumped up with alarm. I then called
him a fool, and proved to him I had been drinking<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-75" id="V1-75"></a>[<a href="./images/1-75.png">75</a>]</span>
water at the time he thought I had been drinking
rum. He laughed, and said, "Ajeeb, ente Y&acirc;kob &acirc;kel:
(Wonderful, you James are wise.)" I then took upon
myself to lecture Mohammed, abusing him for his carelessness
in not preserving the water, and asking him if
he thought that I, on the first time of traversing The
Desert, could put up with dirty water like them, and go
without for days, or with a very small quantity?</p>

<p>The Sheikh Makouran continues very civil: to-day he
gave me a supply of onions for making soup, and promises
to give me a house to live in, when I get to Ghadames.
I have, in turn, to give him some medicine, on my
arrival, for one of his two wives. I rode a little the
Sheikh's donkey last night, at his request. It is
nothing like the camel, it stumbled a great deal over
the loose stones, and I am told the horses stumble as
much. I felt the immense superiority of the camel,
with its slow regular pace and sure foot, in these stony
wastes. The Sheikh's ass is the only animal of the
beast-of-burden sort in the whole caravan, besides the
camels. I noticed, however, a few extra unladen camels,
which take turn with others for carrying, as also several
foals following lightly and friskily their dams. <i>En
route</i>, during the nights, the Arab soldiers amused themselves
by firing off their matchlocks, the most advanced
party answering the farthest behind, and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>. The
noise of the gun broke through the painful silence of
The Desert, and came finely back reverberating from the
Saharan hills with double and treble discharges of
sound. When their powder began to be exhausted, and
they have never more than half-a-dozen charges, they
sang their plaintive love ditties, or chatted to the mer<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-76" id="V1-76"></a>[<a href="./images/1-76.png">76</a>]</span>chants.
On the whole, they showed great good temper,
and, pennyless and naked, were happier than well-clothed
and wealthy merchants.</p>

<p>In the afternoon of yesterday a letter was brought to
me, written by Gameo, which had been in the ghafalah
nearly all the length of the route, but had been forgotten.
This stated that Mr. Macauley, the American
Consul, had kindly prepared a small package of American
rum for my journey, and had forgotten to send it till
too late&mdash;in fact, like several persons in Tripoli, he
really thought, what from the intrigues of the Pasha,
and the obstacles of the season, I should never get off.
I may observe, the nearer a person is to an object, it
often happens he sees it less:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Tis distance lends enchantment to the view."</span>
</div></div>

<p>There is infinitely less enthusiasm for African discovery,&mdash;nay,
more horror of African travelling in Tripoli than
in London: in truth, the greater part of the Europeans
of Tripoli, and in all Barbary towns, are a degraded unenthusiastic
race, wholly occupied with their petty
quarrels and intrigues. Of course, a man of my stamp
was considered by them either "<i>un sciocco</i>" or "<i>un
matto</i>."</p>

<p>It is the misfortune of Africa to be surrounded by a
cordon of vitiated races, half-caste and mongrel breeds,
propagated from adventurers and convicts from the other
continents of the world. So that Africa learns nothing
but the vices of civilization from its contact with the rest
of the world. It is also certain, that the native tribes
of Africa itself are more immoral and barbarous on
the coasts than in the interior.<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-77" id="V1-77"></a>[<a href="./images/1-77.png">77</a>]</span></p>

<p>We have had the full moon during our last four days.
Our route is always more or less south-west.</p>

<p>As I expected, Said is knocked up and lamed. The
Marabout has cheated Said all along out of his rides,
under pretence of his having made him a pair of shoes.
This Marabout is the cunningest, cruellest rogue I ever
met with. But I must here relate a service which he
rendered me of considerable importance. Nobody could
pronounce, at any rate <i>recollect</i>, my name. Mohammed
said to me one day, "<i>Ingleez</i>, we have many
names, have you no more than one? The ghafalah
can't learn your name, it's too difficult. Make a name
like ours, if you haven't one." I then told him I had
another, <i>James</i>, and that it was in Arabic, <i>Y&acirc;kob</i>. Hereupon,
his eyes moved round wildly with joy, and he
cried out,&mdash;"That's it! that's it!" He immediately
started off amongst all the people, calling out my name
was "<i>Y&acirc;kob</i>." This <i>second</i> christening in The Sahara
was an immense advantage to me. There is now not
an oasis in the wildest and farthest region of the Great
Desert but what has heard of <i>Y&acirc;kob</i>. When I arrived
at Ghat I was astonished to find even the Touaricks
calling me <i>Y&acirc;kob, as if I had been brought up with
them</i>. Clapperton and the rest of his party adopted
Mahometan names, and were wise in doing so. When
I was in Fezzan, Clapperton's Arabic name of <i>Abdallah</i>
was mentioned more than twenty years after his death
in Soudan. Denham was called The <i>Rais</i>, being an
officer.</p>

<p>The road from The Mountains to Seenawan is very
good. The greater part, indeed, is beautiful broad carriage-road.
It is generally well marked with camel-<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-78" id="V1-78"></a>[<a href="./images/1-78.png">78</a>]</span>paths,
about a foot wide. These well-beaten, well-trodden
paths, are very sinuous, running one into another,
and often are in great numbers, running parallel in
serpentine style, and containing a united breadth of a
hundred yards. There are a few places where no road-traces
are apparent to the European eye, but the well-practised
eye of the Bedouin camel-driver, like the eye
of the Indian in the American Wilderness, can see
things, and shapes, and signs in The Desert which entirely
escape us. Along the line of route small heaps of
stone are placed, said by my Marabout "to point out the
way." We did not meet a single traveller all the four
days, no small parties&mdash;no couriers&mdash;no one. I shall
not soon forget our reaching Seenawan. It was a few
hours after midnight. I looked forward to it as the
haven of rest from all my sufferings. A fellow-traveller
came up to me, (for I had been asking all night long to
see it,) and said, "See, Y&acirc;kob, there is the <i>Nukhlah</i>
(palms) of Seenawan." Looking through the shadowy
moon-light, I thought I saw something very small and
black, and made a start at it from my camel as if I was
going to leap into a downy bed of rest under the eternal
shade of grateful palms. When the object is
grasped, how its value vanishes! We threw down the
mattress under the shade of a little ruined round tower,
and I fell asleep. But such a tempest got up that the
people waked me, covered with sand, and made me crawl
into a hole, called the door of the <i>burge</i>. Here, amongst
heaps of stones and dirt, I fell asleep again, and did not
wake till called next day near noon.</p>

<p>Seenawan is but a handful of date-trees, thrown upon
the wide waste of The Sahara, with one or two pools of<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-79" id="V1-79"></a>[<a href="./images/1-79.png">79</a>]</span>
sluggish running water, sheltering beneath its palms
thirty or forty inhabitants. There are four or five spots
of vegetation, gems of emerald on the rugged brow of
The Desert. The houses, if such they are, consist of
half a dozen or more of mud hovels huddled together,
here and there a little stone stuck in the walls, and
some dark passages running beneath them. One or two
had a couple of stories and a stone wall round them.
Yet, within, they are cool, and have dark rooms to protect
the inhabitants from both heat and cold. There are
also two or three mud and stone <i>burges</i>, or round
towers, to protect the few dates and spots of green.
Nevertheless, in this pretence of existence, surrounded
by the frightful sterility of The Desert, glowed the
warmth of true hospitality. The Arab merchant, Zalee&acirc;,
who lives here, and had been one of our caravan, made
me come to dine with him in his house, and introduced
me to his family. He gave me for dinner boiled mutton
and sopped bread. When I started next day, he presented
me a supply of eggs and two fowls, a sumptuous
feast in The Desert! I found his wife and daughter
suffering with ophthalmia, and made them up a pint-bottle
of solution for washing the eye. I had had to
wash the eyes of many poor Arabs during the last few
days. I gave Zalee&acirc;'s aged father half a dozen ship's
biscuits, a part of one of which he sopped and ate.
The old gentleman offered up a prayer for my safety,
and said he would save one to eat on my safe return.</p>

<p>The morning of the 20th was horribly hot, but I was
housed and sheltered in the old <i>burge</i>. I received a
present of some fresh dates. This was the small black
date of Ghadames, which is peculiar to two or three<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-80" id="V1-80"></a>[<a href="./images/1-80.png">80</a>]</span>
oases about here. They were delicious as fruits of the
garden of the Houris, and certainly now more esteemed
by me. The Commandant, seeing me write to-day,
wished to have the honour of his name being written in
my journal. It is Omer Ben Aly Ben Kareem Bez-Zeen
Lasee&acirc;. The people showed no jealousy at my
writing notes. Indeed, they were quite aware this was
part of my business, and often assisted in telling me the
names of persons and places. Never went an European
into the interior with less suspicions flying about him
amongst his fellow-travellers. I attribute this, in a great
measure, to the frankness with which I spoke about
Government and the Turkish authorities, as well as the
Consular people of Tripoli. Besides, I never affected to
conceal my objects. Here a man wrote in my journal
the names of abuse applied to the lazy, lagging camels,
for his own especial amusement; viz., "<i>Ya kafer, Ya
kelb, Ya Yehoud</i>, 'Oh thou infidel!' 'Oh thou dog!'
'Oh thou Jew!'" In a quarrel, the Arabs transfer them
complacently to one another, with sundry additions and
oaths, too broad for ears polite. <i>Kafer</i>, ("infidel,") and
<i>Deen El-kelb</i>, ("religion of a dog,") are the most odious
terms of abuse which they can throw at one another.</p>

<p><i>21st.</i>&mdash;We left early this first sprinkle of Seenawan
vegetation, and passed the 22nd at the larger spot of the
oases. This second spot is called Sh&acirc;our; but both
oases are included in the first name, as Ghat and Berkat
are included in <i>Ghat</i>. It is necessary to make these
distinctions in order to guard against error in laying
down the routes. Sh&acirc;our consists of a few stunted date-trees,
a little <i>gusub</i>, a grain esteemed almost as much as
wheat, and one or two fig or other fruit-trees. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-81" id="V1-81"></a>[<a href="./images/1-81.png">81</a>]</span>
united oasis, though but containing a population of sixty
souls, and all very poor people, pay 600 mahboubs per
annum to the Pasha of Tripoli. The oldest man of the
place told me, that, from the first hour of his observation
and recollection, to the present time, the water had
always been the same in quantity. There is always a
little more in the winter. It is running water, and as it
runs and bubbles up to the surface it is distributed over
the little garden plots and patches. I asked him why
he did not make the gardens larger? "God bless you,"
he replied, "we would if we had more water." It is surprising
to notice the regularity of even this scanty supply
of water through the years of an old man's life,
upwards of eighty, in the heart of The Desert, for such
is the site of the oasis of Seenawan. I looked about for
birds, but saw none. My aged informant said, "In the
winter there are some doves." No wild beast haunt the
environs; they cannot get at the water. The people
keep a few sheep, goats, and fowls. There are also a
dozen or so of camels. It is remarkable that the soil of
this speck of vegetable existence is entirely sandy, and
all the water comes out of the sand. But in places,
indeed, on the coast of Barbary, the finest and most
vigorous vegetation often bursts forth out of a purely
sandy soil. By the time all the ghafalah had taken
their supply of water, and the camels had drunk, the
pools were dried up or exhausted, and the people of the
village had to wait for the running of the water. I put a
last question to my aged Saharan <i>Cicerone</i>,&mdash;"How do
you live here, do you work?" "I am always sleeping,"
(or <i>k&#257;&eacute;d</i>, "reposing.") "But, how do you get anything
to eat?" "Oh, I eat every other day, when I can get it,<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-82" id="V1-82"></a>[<a href="./images/1-82.png">82</a>]</span>
and sleep the rest of the time: what can I do?" Such
is vegetable and animal existence here! Nevertheless,
this show and sham of life looks fair, fresh, nay, enchanting,
after the five days' desert; and all, as well as myself,
welcomed Seenawan as a little Hesperides.</p>

<p>We were a tolerably harmonious caravan, but had now
and then a good quarrel. To-day a serious misunderstanding
broke out between the Commandant Omer and one of
the merchants. I could not learn what it was about, but
Omer drew his sword twice to strike the merchant, and
was only prevented doing so by the bystanders rushing
on him. The Sheikh Makouran came to me apart and
said: "Now, if they ask you who's to blame, say both."
We then advanced to the parties, and the Sheikh turned
to me, and said: "<i>Y&acirc;kob</i>, who's to blame?" I immediately
said, though I knew nothing of the business:
"Everybody, all of you." This was the signal for a burst
of laughter, and the group separated. The quarrel,
however, did not finish, it was carried to Ghadames and
settled there. The Arabs enjoy a good quarrel, and,
like good ale, they prefer it, not being too new, but
caulked up a bit. The greater part of their occupation
and amusement is supplied by quarrels.</p>

<p>Before leaving Seenawan the merchants dispatched
a courier to Ghadames, and Mohammed wrote a letter to
the Governor, telling him very pompously: "The English
Consul of Ghadames was approaching the city
under his protection." Mohammed said he had submitted
the letter to the Sheikh Makouran, and it was
approved. I approved of anything that had not my
name attached to it.</p>

<p><i>22nd, 23rd.</i>&mdash;Left in the afternoon, and continued all<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-83" id="V1-83"></a>[<a href="./images/1-83.png">83</a>]</span>
night, till two hours before day-break. Rose at sun-rise
and continued till nearly noon. Halted for the Kailah,
and afterwards resumed our journey, continuing all night.
The people of the ghafalah amused themselves in the night,
by "playing at powder." As they fired the matchlocks,
they shouted the name of the person whom they intended
to honour, mostly firing off the gun just under his nose.
Mohammed was very active in the business, and kept
firing off my praises, and those of the Sheikh Makouran.
This mode of compliment is universal in North Sahara.
The Marabout is a good politician, and knows what he
is about. He knew that Makouran and myself could
serve him. The style of firing off these praises was this:
"Who's this for?" cries the person that has the musket
ready loaded. A number of persons, the flatterers of
the great man, answer, "The Sheikh Makouran!" The
majority has it if other names are mentioned. The
man with his gun then runs before the Sheikh, and fires
it off in his face, or a very short distance from him.</p>

<p>The camel-drivers showed a perverse disposition for
continuing all night the 22nd and 23rd, and would not
halt, without difficulty, for the two or three hours' rest
before day-break. The Commandant called for more
than an hour: "<i>Ya oul&#257;d o&#365;&#259;l k&#257;&eacute;d</i>, (You first fellows
stop!)" I never felt so angry with any people, as I did
with these oulad in advance, I myself was calling out,
"You first fellows stop!" But they were full a mile in
advance. The Arabs are very fond of this sort of disorder
and annoyance to others. Another party took it
into their heads to halt at noon, the 23rd, several miles
from the rest. The Commandant went after them, broke
up their encampment with violence, using his sword to<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-84" id="V1-84"></a>[<a href="./images/1-84.png">84</a>]</span>
hide them, and brought them up to the main body.
Very windy these two days, and got the sand in everything,
cooking utensils, cups, glasses, bowls. We found
the sand, however, occasionally useful, and used it instead
of water for cleaning our platters and cooking pots.
Some of the people say, it is better than water for
cleaning pots and platters.</p>

<p>I have already said how my camel was harnessed,
if harnessing it can be called. First, two panniers were
placed (nicely balanced), which formed a sort of platform
upon a level with the camel's back-ridge and hump; a
mattress and skins next were placed on this, which were
tied down with Arab herb-cords, and carried under the
belly of the camel, securing the panniers as well as the
coverlets. A small ottoman was then put at the top, on
which I sat as on a chair-cushion, with my legs hanging
down on each side of the camel's neck. Sometimes I lay
at my full length across the mattress. But this the
people disapproved of for fear I should fall off. They,
however, frequently slept this way whilst riding. I was
dressed as slightly as possible, and had on a gingham
frock coat, with a leghorn hat. During the time the sun
was above the horizon, I held up an umbrella and tied a
dark-green silk handkerchief over my eyes and face. I
could have borne more clothing, but I think the Moors
and Arabs had too much. They don't change the quantity
with the season, and wear as much in summer as in
winter. The consequence is, they are very cold in winter,
and very much oppressed in summer; but it is mostly
the want of means which does not allow them to change
their clothing with the season. I carried a little bottle
of spirits and water to drink. In the night I was to eat<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-85" id="V1-85"></a>[<a href="./images/1-85.png">85</a>]</span>
a little biscuit. None of the camels had bridles, unless
used solely to ride upon. The camel which I rode
was a very good one, and very knowing, and, like many
knowing animals, very vicious. He was in the habit of
biting all the other camels which did not please him on
their hind quarters, but took care not to get bitten himself.
He seldom stumbled, and I was rarely in fear of
falling. A camel will never plunge down a deep descent,
but always turn round when it comes to the edge of a
precipice. I often rode for several hours with comparative
comfort. The camel-drivers never ride when their
camels are laden, sometimes suffering as much as the
camels themselves. I somewhat offended the self-love
of the people of Ghadames. I asked them whether
Ghadames was bigger than Seenawan. They said pettishly,
"Ghadames <i>blad medina</i>, (Ghadames is a city)."</p>

<p><i>24th.</i>&mdash;Emjessen. Arrived at these wells about 10
<span class="smcap">a.m.</span> Earlier we had passed a place where they were
trying to get water. Emjessen is a vast salt plain, which
is covered over in different parts with a coating of salt,
hard enough and thick enough to furnish materials for
building. And here they were building a <i>burge</i>, "tower,"
or <i>kasbah</i>, "castle," or <i>fonduk</i>, "caravanserai," (all which
names people called it,) with a large wall round the principal
wells, the materials of which were red earth and
lumps of salt, some of which appeared as hard as the
soft Malta stone. The water is, of course, brackish, but
nevertheless the camels drank it with eagerness. I was
staring at the eagerness with which the camels were
drinking, when the Commandant said, "<i>Enh&#257;r s&#259;koun,
Y&acirc;kob</i>," (a hot day, James,) "do the camels in your
country drink water in that way?" Hereat a merchant<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-86" id="V1-86"></a>[<a href="./images/1-86.png">86</a>]</span>
interposed, and instructed the Rais that the English had
no camels, but lived on boats in the water. This is a
very commonly spread opinion respecting the English in
The Desert. But Cailli&eacute; says of the Foulahs near Kankan,
and other tribes: "The prevailing idea of the people in
the interior of Soudan is, that we inhabit little islands in
the middle of the ocean, and that the Europeans wish
to get possession of their country, which is the most
beautiful in the world." Mohammed would not allow his
camels to drink here, and said the water was bad. Emjessen
is situate about ten hours from Ghadames, say, a
short day's journey.</p>

<p>The Sahara all around now showed still more marked
features of sterility, of unconquerable barrenness. Here
too, for the first time, I saw boundless ridges and groups
of sand stretching far away to the south-west, but they
were low squatting heaps. Some sand-hills we had
crossed for an hour or two. Mohammed called them
<i>w&acirc;r</i>, and asked me to descend to save his camel's legs,
I thought my legs less practised in The Desert than the
camel's, and kept my place. Here were spread about,
between the sand-hills and low black stony ridges, plains
of salt and chalk. My first impression was, that the
sea had once covered these regions.</p>

<p>Our route was still south-west, and south, and the
prevailing wind <i>ghiblee</i>, or from about the same quarter.</p>

<p>On leaving <i>Emjessem</i>, we were met in the afternoon by
several friends and relatives of the merchants, who had
come from Ghadames in answer or invitation to our
letters written at <i>Seenawan</i>. These strangers (to me)
were finely mounted upon camels of the Maharee species,
both themselves and their camels dressed out superbly,<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-87" id="V1-87"></a>[<a href="./images/1-87.png">87</a>]</span>
the camels being tightly reined up like coursers. They
had a novel and noble appearance, and I thought I saw
in them something of the genuine features of The
Desert. They had come eight or ten miles an hour, a
long <i>galloping</i> trot, for such is the motion of the camel.
As soon as the two parties met, there was a simultaneous
scamper off of our camels, and some of theirs got very
unmanageable. I was nearly thrown off, and it required
Mohammed and Said to hold my camel until the alarm
had subsided. The Sheikh Makouran was obliged to
dismount and ride his donkey. I asked Mohammed
what was the matter, for I could not understand this
strange confusion all at once amongst the camels. He
cried very angrily, "The camels are drunk, are mad&mdash;God
made them so." When things got more settled, the
merchants explained to me that it was the antipathies
of the two races, the <i>coast</i>-camel, and the Maharee or
<i>desert</i>-camel. That each was alarmed, but the most
fierce and dominant was the Maharee, which always
assumed the mastery over the coast-camel, "like," added
one, "the Touarick assumes to be lord over the Arab."</p>

<p>To-night I was obliged to quarrel seriously with
Mohammed. Said was now quite lame and could not
walk more. I told Mohammed plainly he should have
no present as first promised, since he had broken his
agreement about Said's riding. He then put Said on
a camel. The merchants were much amused at the
quarrel, and thought me an ass to quarrel about <i>a slave</i>,
(for such they esteemed Said) having a ride<a name="FNa_1-18" id="FNa_1-18"></a><a href="#FoN_1-18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>. Some<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-88" id="V1-88"></a>[<a href="./images/1-88.png">88</a>]</span>
few observed I was right, and bullied Mohammed, who
now made another lying excuse, that his two camels
were knocked up, which was the reason Said didn't ride.
The early part of the night he had been riding one of
them himself, and taxing him with this, he said, "Yes,
but was I not ill, didn't you give me some water and
acid, and sugar?" I replied, "Yes, I recollect it too well,
I'm sorry I had so good an opinion of you." The Commandant
now came up, and some bawled, "Here's a
<i>shamatah</i><a name="FNa_1-19" id="FNa_1-19"></a><a href="#FoN_1-19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> with Said," and explained the business. The
Commandant, without any more to do, takes the back
of his sword and belabours Mohammed till he cries for
mercy. Then the people beg the Rais to desist, and
say, "Mohammed is a <i>marabout</i> and must not be
beaten." Mohammed was very cunning, and always took
care to repeat aloud a prayer when we started afresh
from any station, and so gained the esteem of the more
pious. Said rode the rest of the way to Ghadames.</p>

<p>During the greater part of the night of the 24th we
reposed. At dawn of day, on the 25th, we started
fresh on the last march. Just when day had broken
over half the heavens, <i>I saw Ghadames</i>! which appeared
like <i>a thick streak of black</i> on the pale circle of the
horizon. This was its date-woods. I now fancied I
had discovered a new world, or had seen Timbuctoo, or
followed the whole course of the Niger, or had done
something very extraordinary. But the illusion soon
vanished, as vanish all the vain hopes and foolish aspirations
of man. I found afterwards that I had only made
one step, or laid one stone, in raising for myself a monument
of fame in the annals of African discovery!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gradually</span> we neared the city as the day got up.
It was dusty and hot, and disagreeable. My feelings
were down at zero; and I certainly did not proceed to
enter the city in style of conqueror, one who had vanquished
the galling hardships of The Desert, in the most
unfavourable season of the year. We were now met
with a great number of the people of the city, come
to welcome the safe arrival of their friends, for
travelling in The Desert is always considered insecure
even by its very inhabitants. Amongst the rest was the
merchant Essnousee, whose acquaintance I had made in
Tripoli, who welcomed me much to my satisfaction when
thus entering into a strange place. Another person
came up to me, who, to my surprise, spoke a few words
in Italian, which I could not expect to hear in The<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-90" id="V1-90"></a>[<a href="./images/1-90.png">90</a>]</span>
Desert. He followed me into the town, and the Governor
afterwards ordered him to be my turjeman, ("interpreter").
Now, the curiosity of the people became much
excited, all ran to see <i>The Christian</i>! Every body in
the city knew I was coming two months before my arrival.
As soon as I arrived in Tripoli, the first caravan took
the wonderful intelligence of the appointment of an
English Consul at Ghadames. A couple of score of boys
followed hard at the heels of my camel, and some running
before, to look at my face; the men gaped with
wide open mouths; and the women started up eagerly
to the tops of the houses of the Arab suburb, clapping
their hands and <i>loolooing</i>. It is perhaps characteristic
of the more gentle and unsophisticated nature of womankind,
that women of The Desert give you a more lively
reception than men. The men are gloomy and silent, or
merely curious without any demonstrations. I entered
the city by the southern gate. The entrance was by no
means imposing. There was a rough-hewn, worn, dilapidated
gate-way, lined with stone-benches, on which
The Ancients were once accustomed to sit and dispense
justice as in old Israelitish times. Having passed this
ancient gate, which wore the age of a thousand years,
we wound round and round in the suburbs within the
walls, through narrow and intricate lanes, with mud
walls on each side, which inclosed the gardens. The
palms shot their branches over from above, and relieved
this otherwise repulsive sight to the stranger. But I
was too much fatigued and exhausted to notice any
thing, and almost ready to drop from off my camel. In
fact, the distance which I had come since I first saw the
dark palms of the city at the dawn, seemed to exceed<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-91" id="V1-91"></a>[<a href="./images/1-91.png">91</a>]</span>
(mostly the case when exhausted in completing the last
mile of the journey,) all the rest of the route. I now
proceeded forthwith to the Governor, the Rais Mustapha,
being led by the people <i>en masse</i>, who, on seeing me,
said, "<i>Es-slamah! Es-slamah! Es-slamah!</i>" ordered
me coffee, and gave me a cordial welcome. It was
about 10 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> His Excellency was sitting out in the
street on a stone-bench, under the shade. Some visitors
were sitting at a distance, and servants were lounging
about. The Governor's house is without the city, in
the gardens. It was cleanly white-washed, but small,
only two stories high. Before the door it was well
watered, and there was a freshness springing up from
the water just sprinkled about. Several palms cast
gracefully their dark shadows on the street. The Governor
was very sick, his face was tied up, and his eyes
covered. But he smoked incessantly. He said only a
few words through his interpreter. I was equally out
of order, and begged him to allow me to go to the
house which was being prepared for me. He consented;
and two hours after his Excellency sent me a dinner of
mutton, fowls, and rice.</p>

<p>If I were asked my opinion as to this journey, and its
being undertaken by an European, I would answer for
myself, that I would risk it again, because I know my
constitution, and how to treat myself. But I could not
conscientiously recommend it to others in this season of
the year. Were I to perform it again, I would manage
much better. I would be better mounted, have a better
tent, and a better assortment of provisions. Most assuredly
I have great reason to thank Providence that I
am arrived in perfect health.<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-92" id="V1-92"></a>[<a href="./images/1-92.png">92</a>]</span></p>

<p>The whole time from Tripoli to Ghadames had occupied
twenty-three days, but seven or eight had been
consumed by delay in The Mountains. The absolute
distances of travelling given me by Mohammed, are:&mdash;</p>

<p>The French geographers, for some reason, have made
Ghadames situate upon a salt plain, confounding its site
with the salt plain of <i>Emjessen</i>. There is no salt plain
in the suburbs of Ghadames, or the country near. According
to the <i>official</i> letter of the Porte, written by Ali
Effendi, Minister of Foreign Affairs, the oasis is situate
in the <i>Caimakat de Jibel Garbigi</i>. As I did not
receive the Porte's memorandum of my recall from
Ghadames until my return, I made no inquiries of this
mountain <i>Garbigi</i>, but I imagine it exists, though I<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-93" id="V1-93"></a>[<a href="./images/1-93.png">93</a>]</span>
never heard its name. Ghadames is situate in 30&deg; 9&#8242;
north latitude, and in 9&deg; 18&#8242; east longitude.</p>

<p><i>25th.</i>&mdash;I find my house, which had been prepared for
me by the kindness of the Sheikh Haj Mohammed
Makouran, very commodious and tolerably clean, and I
make myself at home. It is situate in the suburbs, close
by the Governor's house. I now tried to get a nap, but
could not. Then I went to bathe in the Mysterious
Spring, whence springs up this city as an emerald amidst
a waste of stone and sand! Intend bathing every day if
I can. Saw Essnousee again, and many of the merchants
whom I had seen at Tripoli. Found them all
civil. But the people who most excited my attention
were the Touaricks, whom I now saw for the first time.
Many of them were here at this time for trading purposes.
They expressed as much astonishment at seeing
me as I them, some exclaiming, "God! God! how could
the Infidel come here?" Late in the afternoon, after napping,
went again into the city: was much pleased with
its appearance. Thought it better than Tripoli, considering
the position of the respective places, Tripoli on
the edge of the sea, and open to all the world, and
Ghadames in the midst of The Desert, far from the
shores of the Mediterranean. No poor are seen begging
about the streets, and all the people look well dressed today.
They had put on their holiday clothes, which is
usual on the arrival of a large caravan. What a contrast
was this to the squalor and filth of Tripoli, with its
miserable beggars choking up all the thoroughfares! No
women were seen about but the half-castes, mostly
slaves, but plenty of children playing here and there. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-94" id="V1-94"></a>[<a href="./images/1-94.png">94</a>]</span>
heard amongst them the whisper of "The Kafer, the
Kafer!" as I passed by.</p>

<p>Began to practise my quackery very early, and administered
solution for the eye in various parts of the
streets <i>pro bono publico</i>. The Rais sent for me likewise,
and I poured a few drops of caustic into his eyes.
In fact, I was full of business, although but a few hours
in the town, and hardly had time to look about me.
This business after such a journey! My turjeman,
Bel-Kasem, also took me into his garden, and gave me a
supply of onions, peppers, and dates. The gardens
appeared quite equal to those of Tripoli. The turjeman
was soon useful, though he only spoke a few words of
Italian, but chiefly because he had less prejudices against
the Christians than his fellow-townsmen. He had
worked in the house of a French merchant in Tunis
many years, and always retained a sort of sneaking
kindness for Frenchmen, which indeed was much to his
credit. In walking about the town, I was followed by
groups of children and black women, all running one
over another to see me. My turjeman was obliged to
beat them to keep them off. I am the <i>second</i> Christian
who has visited Ghadames; the first being the unfortunate
Major Laing, who never returned to record what he saw
in this city! But his residence of a few days here is
forgotten by nearly all the present generation. The
Rais is the only Turk. All the troops are Arabs. The
Ghadamsee people are never soldiers. This evening the
Rais sent me supper, much the same as the dinner.</p>

<p>The people of the ghafalah (the Arab strangers), went
to pray this evening in the mosque set apart for strangers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-95" id="V1-95"></a>[<a href="./images/1-95.png">95</a>]</span>
I must not omit the mention of the strict and scrupulous
exactitude with which all the ghafalah prayed <i>en route</i>.
Five times a day is prescribed by the Koran. Most of
them prayed the five times, but not altogether, some
choosing their own time, a liberty allowed to travellers.
It was a refreshing, though at the same time a saddening
sight, to see the poor Arab camel-drivers pray so
devoutly, laying their naked foreheads upon the sharp
stones and sand of The Desert&mdash;people who had literally
so few of the bounties of Providence, many of them
scarcely any thing to eat&mdash;and yet these travel-worn,
famished men supplicated the Eternal God with great
and earnest devotion! What a lesson for the fat, overfed
Christian! And shall we say, that because these
men are Mohammedans, <i>therefore</i> the portals of heaven
are hermetically sealed against the rising incense of their
Desert prayers? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It is hard to think so .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. though
some think so.</p>

<p><i>26th.</i>&mdash;Employed as yesterday in administering the
medicines. My turjeman did not come to-day, and I
suspected, intuitively almost, the people of Ghadames
had persuaded him not to come. It turned out afterwards
that my suspicions were well-founded; nevertheless,
I received several small presents from the people.
The merchants are civil, but some little jealousy discovers
itself on religious grounds. All Mohammedans
have got an idea that the Christians will one day take
their countries from them, but that, in the end, with
the aid of God, they will revenge themselves, and
repossess all their cities and countries: "This," said my
Marabout, "is a prophecy contained in our sacred books."
My presence is therefore by some considered the pre<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-96" id="V1-96"></a>[<a href="./images/1-96.png">96</a>]</span>liminary
for the overthrow of the Mussulman power of
Ghadames, I am the scout, the spy into "the nakedness
of the land;" others think I pollute the sacred city of
Ghadames with my infidel carcass. Yesterday I got
also entangled in the labyrinth of dark streets, some of
which are often turned into mosques at certain hours of
the day. Of this the people complained to the Rais,
who sent me word to be careful. I replied, I was an
utter stranger, and did not know what I was about; in
fact, the Rais excused me to the people saying, "A little
by little, The Christian will know to do all which is
right. We must teach him." Indeed, I found the conduct
of Mustapha from the first very kind, and he was
determined no improper prejudices should get into the
heads of the people against me. The Rais continued to
send me breakfast, dinner, and supper. "This," said
the servant, "would continue <i>three</i> days, according to
custom;" in fact, I found the same custom adopted by
the Governor of Ghat. Cailli&eacute; mentions the custom as
prevailing amongst the Braknas. But it will soon be
seen that the Rais did not stint his hospitality to this
conventional usage. His Excellency found his eyes
better to-day, and I gave him a dose of pills.</p>

<p>My camel-driver came up to me in his usual soft
sneaking way, and began his pious jargon:&mdash;"God be
praised for Y&acirc;kob, because he has arrived safe in
Ghadames&mdash;now God is one, and above all things powerful.
Besslamah." This he was wont to repeat <i>en
route</i>. He then said gravely, "Now, Y&acirc;kob, you are
my friend&mdash;you wish to go to Soudan, I will go with
you, if you like, but I will sell you my camel, on which
you rode here. You know it's good and very wise. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-97" id="V1-97"></a>[<a href="./images/1-97.png">97</a>]</span>
doesn't stumble. Buy it, I'll sell it because you are my
friend, you shall have it cheap, for twenty-five dollars."
The fact is, the camel had got a small hole in its back,
and being afraid he should not cure the camel, he wanted
me to buy it. Twenty-five dollars is the average price
of a camel.</p>

<p><i>27th.</i>&mdash;Paid a visit this morning to the Rais; told
him the turjeman was afraid to come with me to show
me the city and interpret, because the people said to
him, "Bel-Kasem, thou must not show The Christian the
sacred things of our holy city: never were they polluted
by an infidel." The Rais smiled and ridiculed the thing,
and said he would send for the man. I observed I would
pay him so much per day. "No," he replied, "I am
his master, you are a stranger, I must pay." Whilst we
were talking, a letter came informing the Rais that some
robbers had carried off six camels from the village of
Seenawan. The Rais was displeased and said to me,
"All this country is <i>batel</i> (good-for-nothing)." I asked
the Rais if there were a prison in Ghadames.</p>

<p><i>H. E.</i> "Yes."</p>

<p><i>I.</i> "Is there any body in it?"</p>

<p><i>H. E.</i> "No."</p>

<p><i>I.</i> "How?"</p>

<p><i>H. E.</i> "This is a city of dervishes and marabouts&mdash;people
don't steal&mdash;if they've nothing to eat they beg."</p>

<p>People are calling at my house all day long for
medicines. Every morning I send tea (made, of course,)
to the Rais and the Sheikh Makouran. Presented the
Rais with my Moorish portfolio, all worked over with
various devices in leather and silk. He was quite delighted
with it, observing, "The Christians are good<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-98" id="V1-98"></a>[<a href="./images/1-98.png">98</a>]</span>
people, but the people here don't know them. Y&acirc;kob,
take courage, little by little," (a favourite expression of
the Rais). Next to my house is a garden whose date-trees
bear no fruit, and its beds are covered with dry
dust, a sad picture of neglect. On asking how this was,
I was told the owner was in Soudan, and in consequence
no one looked after and watered his garden. The merchants
of this city often remain in Soudan five, ten, even
fifteen and twenty years, leaving their families here
whilst they accumulate a fortune in commercial speculations.
Sometimes they marry other wives in Soudan,
and form another establishment.</p>

<p>Bathed again in the Spring, but found it surrounded
with women, fetching water. Contented myself with
washing in one of the private washing apartments
attached to the Spring. The water was warm, but I felt
afterwards cool and refreshed. There are no public
baths here as on the coast towns. I observed the place
formed of a high raised stone-bench, just as you enter
the city, (on our side) where all strangers pray. It
seems built on, the principle of some Romanist churches,
which are dedicated, like those of the ancient classic
temples, to particular uses and services. My Marabout
prayed in it with devout fervour as we passed, I being
obliged to wait for him.</p>

<p>This evening dined with the Rais at his house for the
first time. His Excellency was extremely kind and
spoke freely of the Ghadamsee people. "These," said
he, "are a people given up to prayer, and many of them
spend their time in nothing else."</p>

<p>I said, "Are there ten thousand people in Ghadames?
So I have heard."<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-99" id="V1-99"></a>[<a href="./images/1-99.png">99</a>]</span></p>

<p>Astonished, he replied, "There are not five hundred men."</p>

<p>"Are there not several of the people travelling?"</p>

<p>"Only a few."</p>

<p>Then, talking of thieves and banditti, the Rais told
me to bring my money to his house in order that he
might take care of it. On depositing it with him he
asked how much it was. There were only two hundred
piastres of Tunis, all the money I had. The Rais
seemed surprised it was so little (about <i>seven pounds
sterling</i>!) I made the best of it by telling him if I
remained I must send for some more. He also recommended
me not to sleep on the top of the house, but in
my room, and shut the door. However, it is so hot that
I should be suffocated if I were not to leave the door
open. In explanation, he said, "The Touaricks and
other strangers are thieves." The Rais is very sick, with
bad eyes. Sent him some more physic.</p>

<p>Whilst writing my journal, the house is filled with
Touaricks, and I cannot get rid of them. I am obliged
therefore to enter into conversation to amuse them.</p>

<p>"How large is Ghat? as large as Ghadames?"</p>

<p>"Bigger than Tripoli."</p>

<p>"Have you plenty of meat in Ghat?"</p>

<p>"Plenty of everything."</p>

<p>"I am afraid of you&mdash;you killed one of my countrymen
near Timbuctoo?"</p>

<p>"No, no, (crying out lustily,) not the Touaricks of our
country."</p>

<p>"Will you take me safe to Ghat?"</p>

<p>"Upon our lives!" (<i>Drawing their swords across
their foreheads.</i>)<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-100" id="V1-100"></a>[<a href="./images/1-100.png">100</a>]</span></p>

<p>"Have you a written language?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What's your name?" (The Touaricks to me.)</p>

<p>"Here, I will write it."</p>

<p>"Have you any medicine for the eye?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>I then applied some solution to the eyes of one of
them. Another said:</p>

<p>"My son is always coughing<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads ','">.</ins> What shall I do for him?"</p>

<p>"Bring him here," I said, "in the morning, and I will
give him something."</p>

<p><i>The Touarick.</i>&mdash;"You won't poison him?"</p>

<p><i>I.</i>&mdash;"No, no."</p>

<p>They then entered upon a religious conversation.</p>

<p>"What do you think of <i>religion</i>? Do you pray?"</p>

<p>"Well, there is one God."</p>

<p>"And, Mohammed?"</p>

<p>"He is the prophet of the <i>Arabs</i>."</p>

<p>"Who is your prophet?"</p>

<p>"Jesus; he is Prophet of all the Christians, as Moses
is the prophet of the Jews."</p>

<p>(With impatience.) "But Mohammed?"</p>

<p>"We Christians have but one Prophet, who is Jesus."</p>

<p>Here an interruption took place, of which I was very
glad. Afterwards they resumed:</p>

<p>"Have you any powder?"</p>

<p>"No; I am an English Marabout, and carry no arms,
and have nothing to give away but medicines."</p>

<p>"Aye, an English Marabout, and not a merchant?"</p>

<p>"No; only a Marabout."</p>

<p>One of them. "We shall take your name as you
have written it on this paper, and show it to our people.<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-101" id="V1-101"></a>[<a href="./images/1-101.png">101</a>]</span>
It will be esteemed precious by them; and if you ever
wander that way through The Desert, they will ask you
your name, and, if you reply to it, they will not kill you,
but give you plenty of camel's milk. If they have not
your name they may kill you, and not their fault."</p>

<p>Had a visit from the Sheikh of the slaves. In most
countries of North Africa there is a chief appointed by
Government for any particular race, not the same as the
ruling dynasty, domestic as well as foreign, which may
be resident in the towns and cities. So the Jews of
Barbary have their chiefs, and the slaves theirs. In
Tunis a number of free coloured people, called <i>Waraghleeah</i>,
emigrants from the Algerian oasis of Warklah,
have also their chief or headsman. This chief has rather
large and even discretionary powers, and can order
his subjects to be imprisoned by the officers of the
sovereign Government of the country. But, of course,
this imperium in imperio is subject to the supervision of
the supreme Government. The object is apparently to
relieve the Government, but whilst it relieves the higher
authorities, it inflicts irreparable injuries upon poor
people, and is full of the most gigantic abuses. It is
often complained of by the Levant correspondents of
newspapers, under the character of the various spiritual
tribunals of Eastern Christians inflicting fines, torture,
and imprisonment on refractory or heretic members of
those churches. The Jewish synods of Africa and the
East exercise the same arbitrary powers, under the sanction
of the supreme Mahometan authorities. Lately, however,
the European ambassadors have done something to
check these abuses in the dominions of the Porte.</p>

<p>After some conversation, I asked the Sheikh of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-102" id="V1-102"></a>[<a href="./images/1-102.png">102</a>]</span>
Ghadames slaves what were his duties. Drawing himself
up into a posture of authority, he replied:&mdash;"Be it
known, Oh Christian! I am the Sheikh of the slaves, my
name is Ahmed. I am from Timbuctoo. The people of
Bambara are the finest in the world. They are brave&mdash;they
fear none. Now, hear me: I know all the names
of the slaves in Ghadames: I watch over all their conduct,
to punish them when they behave badly, to praise
them when they do well. They all fear me. For my
trouble I receive nothing. I am a slave myself. I rarely
punish the slaves. We have always here more than two
hundred. If you wait, plenty of slaves will soon come
from Soudan!"</p>

<p>Late to-night, Mohammed the Marabout of Rujban,
left for his country and Tripoli. I gave him some
Ghadames dates to take to Tripoli as presents, the small
black dates, as a rarity, and to let the people know I
had not so much forgotten them as they had forgotten
me. This clever, cunning, selfish fellow, I completely
overreached. He never believed that I had the courage
to punish his bad conduct. I had promised him, besides
the ten mahboubs (about forty shillings), the hire of the
two camels from Tripoli to Ghadames, a present, or backsheesh
of two mahboubs, on his behaving well. On paying
him his ten mahboubs I told him there was no backsheesh.
At first he was astonished and looked pale, shaking in
every limb, for he expected to reap a great harvest by
my affair&mdash;even a double present to what was promised.
But on reflecting that he had lamed Said, who was still
laid up, had pilfered our provisions all the way, and lived
on us by force, although the agreement was that he
should keep himself, he confessed I was right, or thought<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-103" id="V1-103"></a>[<a href="./images/1-103.png">103</a>]</span>
it better to make the confession. However, he beat
about the merchants, and got two or three of them to
come down to speak to me, who said, "If he has done
bad, treat him bad, that is, give him a little backsheesh."
I then gave him half a dollar. His ingenuity was never
exhausted. He pretended I ought to feed the camels
two or three days after their arrival, which he said was
the rule. There is no herbage for miles in the neighbourhood
of Ghadames. The people are sometimes
obliged to drive their camels to Seenawan, or Derge,
two or three days' distance, to feed. I gave way, and
added a trifle. He then begged something for his wife;
he had bought her a pair of Ghadames shoes, worked
with silk, which shows an Arab can have an affectionate
remembrance for his wife, but which has been denied by
some. I again added something. He now had his supper.
I gave him a feed of mutton, and broth and bread.
This was his feast before parting, for I did not like to
send him away as a blackguard, notwithstanding he had
extremely annoyed me. I never saw a person eat with
such voracity. After his allowance, or the supper I
had cooked him, a large supper was sent in by the Rais
for three. He set to and ate his own and Said's share
in the bargain. I have often seen Arabs gorge in this
way, but, what is most singular, when obliged to be
abstemious they scarcely eat the amount of two penny
loaves per day. Mohammed was a good type of this
Arab abstemiousness and voracity. When he kept himself,
he only took a small and most frugal meal once a
day. Of his gluttony I may add, that I was obliged to
separate his mess from that of Said when he dined with
me. If not, he would eat Said's mess and his own<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-104" id="V1-104"></a>[<a href="./images/1-104.png">104</a>]</span>
before I could see what they were about. At last Mohammed
began to soften and to confess adroitly, for he
was one of the acutest Arabs I ever met with. He
observed to me, in a whining tone, "Now I am going,
I wish to tell you something. You think me very bad,
and a great rogue, and so I am; but, I tell you, if you
had had any other Arab you would have found him a
thousand times a bigger rogue than myself, <i>for all the
Arabs are dogs</i>. This is the truth: (<i>El-khok</i>.)" After
this confession, I gave him a certificate of my having
arrived safe in Ghadames under his guidance. This I
could not object to do, in order that he might show it
to the Pasha and the English Consul. Some of his
remarks were full of <i>sel</i>, but mostly touched with selfishness.
One evening, looking at his camels feeding, he
said, "Ah, Y&acirc;kob, see those camels eat. It does my
heart good to see them, for what am I without my
camels, what are the Arabs without the camels&mdash;are
not the camels the pillars which support the Arab's
house?" At other times he would abuse his fellow
camel-drivers for coming into my tent, upbraiding them,&mdash;"What,
do you want to rob The Christian? Am not
I encharged with his affairs?" Mohammed was rather
tall, and of lean habit of body, like all Arabs. His
hearing and sight were very quick, and he always seemed
to sleep like a watch-dog. His bravery I never tested.
He was mostly lively and facetious. He was good-looking,
and about thirty years of age.</p>

<p>I saw him after my return to Tripoli. He wanted
to go with me again. He said to me, "Now you have
seen all, The Mountains, The Sahara, and the Touaricks.
You know all our affairs, and everything we do." As a<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-105" id="V1-105"></a>[<a href="./images/1-105.png">105</a>]</span>
literary curiosity, I shall here translate my camel-driver's
account of the route from Tripoli to Ghadames, written
at my request, in which will be seen the camel-driver's
minute acquaintance with the route, and how every wady,
and well, and mountain, is particularized. This is the
style of the Saharan travellers and chroniclers.</p>

<p>"First Tripoli, and not far from it are palms of El-Hamabaj,
and a mosque El-Kajeej. You then proceed
to Gargash, in which are palms, and along the road the
Kesar Jahaly. And you go on to Janzour, in which are
palms and two castles, one of them is called Kesar Areek,
and the Kesar of the Turkish soldiers (God curse them!)
Upon the sea-shore is the mosque of Sidi Abd-el-Jeleel.
And you proceed to Seid, where are palms and the
Indian fig. And you go on to Ghafeeah, and here is cool
refreshing water, (oh! how delicious in the great heat!)
and you pass the water to El-Toubeem, where are palms,
and mosques, and houses. You go on to Zaweeah, where
are palms, houses, and a Kesar for troops, and a Zaweeah
for the reading of The Sublime Koran, and mosques.
You proceed thence to Houshel, in which are palms and
houses. You move on to Aabareeah, where are palms.
You now reach The Sahara, where there is a little sand;
you find in it the well of El-Hamra. Pursuing your way
upon The Sahara, you find the well of Esh-Shaibeeah.
And travelling on The Sahara you find another well
called Lakhreej. You travel further on The Sahara, and find
Afoub Aaly, where there is sand, called El-Hal.
And after it, you find Wady Lethel, in which are lote-trees
and the lethel, a large tree like an olive-tree. And
you travel to El-Jibel, where are houses and a Kesar for
troops. In the country called Yefran, are olive-trees<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-106" id="V1-106"></a>[<a href="./images/1-106.png">106</a>]</span>
and fig-trees; and below the country (or in the plains),
you find palms. And near El-Gibel, in all the countries
you find olive-trees and fig-trees, as far as the other mountains
westward. Now Rujban (my happy country, the
blessing of God on it!) has seven countries, viz.:&mdash;El-Barahem,
and Tarkat, and Sharn, and Z&acirc;feran, and Ghalat,
and Zantan, and Tarbeeah.</p>

<p>"We mounted from Rujban and from El-Gibel, and
went to Eth-Tha, where is Koteet, between Ez-Zantan
and Rujban. Thence we travelled to Wady Souk-ej-Jeen.
Thence to Haram and Et-Teen. And we travelled to
Wady-Azgheer, and afterwards Wady Walas. Thence
we arrived again on The Sahara, called El-Hamrad,
which is <i>fertile</i><a name="FNa_1-20" id="FNa_1-20"></a><a href="#FoN_1-20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> land, and on it are lote-trees, bearing
berries (<i>nebek</i>). Now, oh Y&acirc;kob! this is not the lote-tree
in the seventh heaven, near the presence of Rubbee
(God), and which Gabriel, nor our lord Mahomet, dare
not pass beyond. Alas! O Y&acirc;kob, if you believe not
in Mahomet, you cannot be near this lote-tree. It says
in the Koran, 'It covers the concealed<a name="FNa_1-21" id="FNa_1-21"></a><a href="#FoN_1-21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>.' And we
ascended a hill,&mdash;a high hill, that is to say, a little
mountain. And we ascended (descended?) to a wady,
called Ahween, in which is a well on the west of the
route. And after this is Esh&acirc;ab, small wadys, called
Esh&acirc;ab Eth-Thoueeb, and after them is Wady Seelas,
where there is a well of water. You pass by it on the
road, and come to Seenawan, in which is a spring of
water, called Spring Aly. In Seenawan are palms, and
its <i>ghotbah</i> is like a tower (burge), built with small stones,<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-107" id="V1-107"></a>[<a href="./images/1-107.png">107</a>]</span>
and so of the country (village) near it. And after this
is the country Esh-Sh&acirc;our, where there is water from
springs which run upon the face of the earth, and palms
and houses built with small stones. From The Mountains
to Seenawan are four days with heavily laden
camels.</p>

<p>"Afterwards you travel and find Wady Babous Eth-Theeb.
Thence there is land, on which is sand, and in
this the well of water El-Wateeah. After there is
Wady Ej-Jeefah. Then Saheer El-Maharee, and then a
long stream, in which are reeds. Afterwards you find
Hinsheer El-Basasah. And after El-Bab-Rumel ("gate
of sand"), a difficult place. Thence you come to Emjessem.
All this route is Sahara; and the road from
Seenawan to Emjessen is two days' journey. After this
you find the small mountains Ba&acirc;rbeeah Aghour. Then
you find Ghadames. There is a day's journey from
Emjessen to Ghadames."</p>

<p><i>28th.</i>&mdash;Early this morning made the tour of the city's
walls and gardens. Went with Said, and myself, alone.
I am fond of being alone, and would sometimes walk
miles over The Desert&mdash;the caravans being not even in
sight. This <i>was</i> solitude!</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">"I love all waste</span>
<span class="i0">And solitary places; where we taste</span>
<span class="i0">The pleasure of believing what we see</span>
<span class="i0">Is boundless, as we wish our souls to be."</span>
</div></div>

<p>It occupied us, at a moderate rate of walking, about
an hour and a half, so that the oasis may be about
five miles in circumference. What a scene of hideous
desolation did the environs present&mdash;nor tree, nor herb,
nor living creature! Talk of the Poles, there is less life<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-108" id="V1-108"></a>[<a href="./images/1-108.png">108</a>]</span>
here! On the west, the groups of sand-hills, which
stretch ten days' journey, were all bright as the light,
and sometimes not visible from brilliancy. Some Touaricks
saw us going, and called after us; we took no
notice of them. The Rais, on my return, asked many
questions, about what I thought of the city, and observed,
"These poor fools think there's no city like
theirs, but what would they think if they saw Stamboul?
Those who have not seen Stamboul have not
seen the world!" The walls of the city of Ghadames,
like the houses, are built mostly of sun-dried bricks, but
parts of small stones and earth. They are in a ruinous
condition, and in many places open to The Desert.
But within these outer walls are garden-walls and winding
paths, so that the approaches to the city are difficult,
except by the southern gate. Formerly, four or five
gates were open, but the Rais has shut them all but this
one for security, as well as facility in collecting the
octroi, or gate-dues.</p>

<p>The greater part of the camels of our ghafalah left today,
but unladen, there being no Soudan goods now in
Ghadames. These camels belong to The Mountains,
and are hired by the merchants to convey their goods
between this and Tripoli. The ordinary price paid is
two dollars per camel. The weight the camel carries is
from two to three cantars.</p>

<p>This afternoon had a visit from the Touarick women,
and was astonished to find some of them <i>almost fair</i>.
They were pretty and plump, coquettish and saucy, asking
a thousand questions. It is evident the men are
dark simply from exposure to the sun. I regaled them
with <i>medicine</i> and tea. This party belongs nearly all to<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-109" id="V1-109"></a>[<a href="./images/1-109.png">109</a>]</span>
Touat. They want to prevail upon me to go with
them. I am almost inclined. Two men, who came
with the women, assured me I should go safe and sound.
I believe I could, provided I go as poor as a beggar,
distributing only medicines. This evening dined again
with the Rais. He is now a little better, and puts his
charms over his eyes, as if the charms cured them, and
not the caustic of nitrate of silver. His Excellency
talked of the affairs of the city; he pretends the antiquity
of Ghadames goes back four thousand years, to
the times of Nimrod and Abraham. The people of the
town, I suppose, have told him so; but where is their
authority? He says of <i>present</i> matters,&mdash;"The people
pay 6,000 mahboubs per annum; it is too small a sum
for a city of merchants; there is little money in the
country, it being mostly deposited in the hands of merchants
in Tripoli; he wishes Christians established here,
and a regular souk, or market, opened; the number of
Arab troops which he has here is 120; he is building
barracks and a fondouk at Emjessen, in order to station
troops there to guard the wells, for the banditti come
there and drink water, and then lie in ambush to plunder
caravans." This building of forts at wells is a wise
and efficient measure; the same thing has been done
at the oasis of Derge. The Rais receives his pay <i>direct</i>
from the Sultan of Constantinople; his appointment is
quite uncertain; he is a native of Erzeroum; he took
part in the Turco-English campaign in Syria, served
under General Jochmus, and was acquainted with many
English officers. He has been at Constantinople,
Smyrna, Malta, and many other parts of the Upper
Mediterranean.<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-110" id="V1-110"></a>[<a href="./images/1-110.png">110</a>]</span></p>

<p>People complain that the gardens languish for want of
money to cultivate them; not more than half of the
date-trees bear fruit this year, owing entirely to the
want of labour and irrigation. People have to purchase
water. I have seen no birds in the oasis up to this time.</p>

<p>The greater part of yesterday and to-day occupied in
distributing medicines. Afraid I shall soon finish my
stock. The medicines were furnished by the British
Consul-General of Tripoli, at the expense of Government;
there were only five pounds-sterling worth.
Ramadan begins in a few days; then I shall not have so
many customers. Then the Moors cast physic to the dogs.</p>

<p><i>29th.</i>&mdash;Went this morning to see the Souk. At the
time of my visit there were only a few tomatas, peppers,
a little olive-oil, and some grain, wheat and barley,
exposed for sale. Passed a butcher's, where a whole
camel was killed and cut up. Told in this way it fetches
about thirty shillings. Paid a visit to my runaway
Turjeman, who said he would call upon me this evening.</p>

<p>Observe the Rais employs, in his administration, all
strangers, either Arabs or Tripolines, or people from
Derge and Seenawan. How true are the principles of
despotism! This is upon the same principle as the
employment of the Swiss at Naples; in both cases the
despotic government cannot trust the people. The Rais
is very busy in collecting the half-yearly tax: he works
with surprising zeal from morning to night&mdash;a zeal worthy
of a better cause.</p>

<p>I am told the nearest route from here to Tunis is <i>vi&acirc;</i>
Douwarat (or Duerat), a portion of the Atlas where is
situate Shninnee. This village, scattered over all the
hills, is three days from Ghabs and seven from Ghadames.<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-111" id="V1-111"></a>[<a href="./images/1-111.png">111</a>]</span>
The Souf Arabs tell me there is no water for seven days
in summer and twelve in winter, on the road they came
from their country to Ghadames, the difference being the
length of days. The well is called Beer-es-Saf, and
sometimes Beer-ej-Jadeed. The route lies entirely
through sand, N.W. This region of sand is the celebrated
hunting-place of the Souf Arabs.</p>

<p>Dined again with the Rais this evening. His Excellency
complained that the Ghadamsee people show him
scarcely any attention. He never receives the smallest
present, neither a few dates, nor a melon, nor a vegetable;
he buys and is obliged to buy everything<a name="FNa_1-22" id="FNa_1-22"></a><a href="#FoN_1-22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>. I thought
myself more fortunate than the Rais, for I have received
several little presents from various individuals. His
Excellency says he never punishes the people except for
<i>abusive language</i> to one another, and than he only gives
them twenty or fifty strokes of the bastinado. In this
respect he says, "Ghadames may be compared to Paradise,
there being no crime in it." His Excellency repeated
that the greater number of the resident inhabitants,
who do not travel abroad, spend their time in
reading, writing, and prayer&mdash;that, emphatically, this
is <i>a Marabout city</i>.</p>

<p><i>30th.</i>&mdash;Occupied two or three hours this morning in
administering medicine and visiting the sick. My turjeman
came back and apologized; he said the people
were fanatic. Received a visit from Haj-el-Beshir, eldest
son of the Sheikh Makouran. He said his father had
been twice to Timbuctoo, and resident there many years,<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-112" id="V1-112"></a>[<a href="./images/1-112.png">112</a>]</span>
and would give me some information. The Rais says
there's no Sheikh of the slaves, and adds, "I'm the
Sheikh of the slaves." This again is not correct, as the
people all told me, there must be a headman or Sheikh
of the slaves in all countries. Had a visit from two
young men who were quite free from the prejudices of
their countrymen. They told me to take courage, "that
God was the Maker of Christians as well as Mohammedans,
that in this city no one could do me harm, but
I was not to expose myself to the ignorant." I seem,
indeed, to get on better with the people, their prejudices
apparently are beginning to give way; I shall be able to
open the way for some other person. The father of one
of my young friends has been now twelve years in
Kanou; when he returns he brings a fortune.</p>

<p>Speaking to the Rais of the Ghadamsee people, I asked
him what they did for soldiers before the Turks came?
He replied, "These people are not soldiers and never
had soldiers; they are like women and children; if any
body came from The Desert to plunder, he stole what he
pleased and was allowed to go away unmolested. They
depended upon God and prayer for their protection.
You see I told you these people were dervishes." Still
there is reason to believe that if they did not fight themselves,
as, at the present time, they got their quondam
but powerful friends, the Touaricks, to fight for them.</p>

<p>This afternoon saw some doves in the gardens; and
also a small flight of birds hovering over the city, perhaps
there were twenty. These birds were called <i>arnout</i>,
and have very long bills and necks. When the men
leave off working at the wells, they dart down to drink.
The palm-groves are the favourite resort of the doves, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-113" id="V1-113"></a>[<a href="./images/1-113.png">113</a>]</span>
poetical as natural. Animals, and especially birds, are
so rare in those regions that every sight of them is
worthy of mention; indeed, these are the first birds I
have seen since I left Tripoli. No meat to be had to-day
in Souk. People usually club together and buy a
whole sheep: they then kill it, and divide it into so
many portions according to the number of purchasers;
so that meat is rarely exposed publicly for sale, and it is
necessary to join these private purchasers. Purchase-money
is always paid down at once and not on delivery.
The meat is never weighed but divided at guess. When
any disagreement takes place lots are drawn for the
division.</p>

<p>During the four or five days of my residence here,
the weather has been comparatively temperate; at least,
I have not felt the heat excessive. To-day has been
close and cloudy: no sun in the afternoon: wind hot,
<i>ghiblee</i>. I continue to be an object of curiosity amongst
the people, and am followed by troops of boys. A
black from Timbuctoo was astonished at the whiteness
of my skin, and swore I was bewitched. The Ghadamsee
Moors eat sugar like children, and are as much
pleased with a suck of it. The young men carry it
about in little bags to suck. The Rais is sometimes
called <i>Bey</i> by the people and sometimes <i>Sultan</i>, but by
the low people, not the better classes. Here, as elsewhere,
the lower classes are the more servile.</p>

<p><i>31st.</i>&mdash;Went this morning to buy meat, but got some
with great difficulty. Passed some Touaricks, who
showed an excessive arrogance in their manners. They
look upon the Ghadamsee people with great disdain,
considering them as so many sheep which they are to<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-114" id="V1-114"></a>[<a href="./images/1-114.png">114</a>]</span>
protect from the wolves of The Sahara. Met several of
the merchants I knew at Tripoli. They asked me how
I liked their city, and if better than Tripoli. I always
replied, <i>Haier</i> (better). It is singular that though these
merchants are so enterprising themselves in the interior
of Africa, they cannot conceive of the possibility of a
Christian coming so far from home into The Desert, and
when I tell them I wish to go to Soudan, or Bornou, or
Timbuctoo, they look at me with incredulity and say,
"No, no, you cannot go so far, you will die, or the
people will kill you." They have not the least idea of
the courage and enterprise of European tourists, nor can
they understand their objects. But these their objections
may be founded in jealousy of us Christians.</p>

<p>The following is a nice neat facsimile specimen of the
writing of a young taleb and Ghadamsee Marabout, one
of the best I have seen in The Desert. It is a bill of sale,
consisting of gold&mdash;slaves, male and female&mdash;bullocks'
skins&mdash;pillow-cases&mdash;elephant's teeth&mdash;senna&mdash;bekhour
(perfume)&mdash;camels&mdash;sacks&mdash;and (I think) household
slaves.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill1-05.jpg"><img src="./images/ill1-05_th.jpg" alt="Facsimile Specimen of the Writing of a Young Taleb" title="Facsimile Specimen of the Writing of a Young Taleb" /></a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-115" id="V1-115"></a>[<a href="./images/1-115.png">115</a>]</span></p>

<p>The young taleb showed great consequence and presented
me with the original. He observed that a
metegal of gold is of the value of 33&frac12; Tunisian piastres.
I said, "Will you come to my house and I will show
you an Arabic book (the Bible) containing the religion
of the Jews and Christians?"</p>

<p><i>The Taleb</i>: "I, I enter the house of an infidel! God
preserve me!"</p>

<p>"Oh!" I observed, "you are afraid of me and my
books&mdash;my books <i>will bite you</i>." Hereupon all the
people present burst into a loud laugh, and the taleb
looked quite crest-fallen.</p>

<p>Many people blind with one eye, and some with two
eyes, come to me to be cured, but I can do nothing for
them. One poor old man comes every morning. I wash
his eyes with a solution of the Goulard powders. He,
though nearly seventy years of age, still lives in the
hopes of recovering his sight. How faithful a companion
of the unfortunate is hope! The Touaricks use mustard
for bad fingers and hands. They also cut and carve
their backs for blood-letting, and the marks remain for
years upon years. I saw one of them whose back was
scarred and scarified all over.</p>

<p>This morning visited my turjeman at his house. The
house is a <i>mezzonina</i>, having no ground-floor apartments;
the parlour, or grand room, or hall, was surrounded, to
my surprise, with small apartments, in which three or
four sheep were fattening, as people fatten pigs. The
sheep is with the Ghadamsee people what the pig is with
the Irish, their <i>dii penates</i>. There was also another
story above this, the sleeping-room; and then on the
terrace, or flat roof, are other little rooms. All the<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-116" id="V1-116"></a>[<a href="./images/1-116.png">116</a>]</span>
apartments were exceedingly small, but their situation
high. Stone stairs lead from one room to another.
The turjeman told me all the houses were built in the
same manner, but some larger. Indeed some houses are
four stories high, besides the terrace. The lower rooms
are mostly used as magazines. As soon as I ascended
the staircase, the wife of the turjeman pretended to take
fright, and hid herself in a private apartment. At
another time when I called, and her husband was absent,
she came out to see me, and collected all the women in
two or three neighbours' houses to see The Christian.
It is the husband the woman of Africa is frightened at,
and not the stranger. The tyranny of men over the sex
of feebler bodily frame is co-extensive with the population
of the world. It is the same in Paris, in London,
Calcutta, and The Desert. But the principle of women-seeing
in Ghadames and all North Africa is simply this:
"If the woman is poor, or the husband poor, she may
be seen; if rich, she cannot be seen." A pretty woman
will, however, always try to let you see her face if she
can.</p>

<p>There is a very good-natured black dervish always
about the streets, but clean and well-dressed. Ordinarily
amongst these saints filth and piety go hand in hand.
They abhor the proverb of cleanliness being next to godliness.
The poor fellow is very fond of me, is running in
and out of my house all day long. I always shake
hands with him when I meet him. The Moors approve
my conduct and say: "Ah, Y&acirc;kob, he's a saint." Once
the cunning fellow, when he noticed a lot of half-caste
women anxious to see me, took hold of my head and
turned me completely round to show my face to them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-117" id="V1-117"></a>[<a href="./images/1-117.png">117</a>]</span>
He has some sense, good simpleton, and is without
malice; consequently a great favourite with the people.
A pity all madmen were not like this poor dervish. Yet
how many would be as harmless and beloved as he if
they were not confined, and caged, and chained, in civilized
and Christian madhouses! The dog knows I'm a
<i>kafer</i>, and said to my camel-driver, the day of my arrival,
"Why did you bring the Christian to our holy city?"
chiding him.</p>

<p>This afternoon we went to see the Touaricks "play
with camels"&mdash;&#8238;&#1610;&#1604;&#1593;&#1576;&#1608;&#1575; &#1605;&#1593; &#1575;&#1604;&#1580;&#1605;&#1604;&#8236;&mdash;that is, perform a sort of
camel-race. Strange coincidence of civilized and barbarian
life! This was the Epsom and Ascot of The
Desert. But I was never more disappointed. All that
the Touaricks did with their camels was, they dressed
them out most fantastically with various coloured leather
harness, that is to say, the withers, neck, and head; they
reined them up tightly like blood-horses; and then rode
them a full trot in couples. This was the whole of the
grand play with camels. Some, however, would not fall
into this trot of couples, and grumbled terrifically. The
<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Touraricks'">Touaricks</ins> who rode these restive camels were saluted
by the spectators with loud laughter, the effect of which
was painted sullenly in their faces. I never saw men
look so <i>couldn't help it</i> like. One of them was a young
Touarick who had been saucy to me. I was not displeased
to see him in this <i>triste</i> position. The camels
were the genuine Maharee, of course; the Touaricks have
no other camels. The men were dressed out also in their
gayest barbaric finery. A tent was dressed up, around
which squatted a group of Desert jockies, with their fierce
spears bristling above in the sun before them, like the<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-118" id="V1-118"></a>[<a href="./images/1-118.png">118</a>]</span>
lords of creation. Even a banner floated gaily in the
bright sun from the tent top. A great concourse of
Ghadamsee spectators were present, one of whom swore
to me that a Maharee once passed from Ghadames to
Tripoli <span class="smcap">in one day</span>, but that the rider died instantly
from exhaustion, on his arrival. Another Maharee outstripped
the wind, but as it was a strong cold wind, the
animal died when it got into hot atmosphere, to which
the tempest was driving.</p>

<p>Had a long conversation with a Touarick about a
journey to Timbuctoo. I offered him five hundred dollars
to escort me; but, to deposit the money in the hands of
the Governor of Ghadames, or a respectable merchant,
till my and his safe return. Said I would take nothing
with me but medicines, and a little provision, and go in
<i>form&acirc; pauperis</i>, as a dervish or doctor. All the Ghadamsee
people present approved this way of going, and admired
its wisdom, as removing all temptation to attack me, or
to steal anything from me when I had nothing to steal.
But the Touarick could not come up to the scratch, and
was frightened to take upon himself the responsibility,
observing, "You are a Christian; the people of Timbuctoo
will kill you unless you confess Mahomet to be the
prophet of God."</p>

<p>Dined this evening with the Rais. His Excellency
said: "Formerly, when Ghadames was governed by the
Moorish Bashaws, the people paid little or nothing.
There are but three or four rich persons now here, the
rest are poor, or have only a few mahboubs to carry on a
petty trade." At night, the streets are enveloped in
pitch darkness, whether the moon be up or not. I
endeavoured to persuade the Rais to make the people<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-119" id="V1-119"></a>[<a href="./images/1-119.png">119</a>]</span>
light up the town with a few lamps, having oil enough
in them to last till midnight. "Good," he observed,
"but the people say it was always so, and it must be so
still. What can I do?" There are no coffee-houses in
Ghadames; people drink coffee inside their houses. I
threatened the merchants to set up Said as a <i>kahwagee</i>,
(coffee-house keeper). They laughed, and said, "None
will buy." For conversation people collect in groups round
shops, in the <i>Souk</i>, or in little squares near the mosques,
where there are many stone benches for reclining on, or
in some quiet dark nook and corner, where, when you
expect to find no one, you fall foul of a retired circle
of gossips, squatting down in utter darkness. These
Saharan streets are veritable catacombs.</p>

<p><i>1st September.</i>&mdash;This morning, wonderful! It broke
with a few drops of rain; to me most pleasant, and welcomed
as falling pearls of nectar. At noon the sky
became as dry and inflamed as ever. Went to the
Spring early to bathe. Found it surrounded with women,
nearly all half-castes and female slaves. They pretended
to be in a great fright, as all were washing and dabbling
in the water. I came away. A man said, "The Christian
must not go to the well in the morning, but only
in the evening." There seems to be a tacit understanding,
that from day-break to a couple of hours afterwards,
the women shall have possession of the well, for purification
purposes, according to the rites of religion.</p>

<p>This morning took coffee with the Rais; as no one
was present, he began talking politics. "By a little
and a little," he said, "we shall take possession of Ghat.
We can't do it by force, it would require some thousand
men to take it by arms. The Touaricks are all robbers<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-120" id="V1-120"></a>[<a href="./images/1-120.png">120</a>]</span>
and devils." I asked him if he would not like to occupy
Touat. He replied, "No, there's another Sultan there,
and another people. There are two Sultans in the world,
one in the East and one in the West (<i>Muley-Abd-Errahman</i>).
Ghat we might take. At Touat we are too near
the French, and might quarrel with them. All the
freebooters come from Tunis. The Bey has no power or
authority over the Arabs there. His government is bad;
he's a madman. Our Pasha has often written to him
about these freebooters, but it's no use. The English
and the Sultan are one, and always friends, whatever
may be the condition of the rest of the world." Speaking
of me:&mdash;"You are mad to think of going to Timbuctoo;
you are sure to have your throat cut."</p>

<p>I allow all persons, rich and poor, young and old, men
and women, to come and see me. At the same time I
make a distinction between those who are likely to be
useful to me and mere idle intruders. All the Arab
soldiers come, and, in general, though poor and thievish,
they have less of prejudices, and like the English better
than the Ghadamsee people. This city has not yet felt
the benefit of English influence, and interference in
Tripoli, and therefore the merchants have not the same
reasons for being friendly to the English as the Arabs of
The Mountains and the townspeople of Tripoli. All
the Ghadamseeah agree with me, that the camel-playing
of the Touaricks was a failure. Five slaves are leaving
for Tripoli. The poor things complained of having
nothing to eat; I sent Said with some victuals for them.
The people continue to be friendly, and the merchants,
whose acquaintance I made in Tripoli, very much so.
The steward of the Rais has arrived from Tripoli in<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-121" id="V1-121"></a>[<a href="./images/1-121.png">121</a>]</span>
fourteen days. His whole party consisted of six camels
and five persons. So much for the pretended insecurity
of the route! He is dressed in the Turco-European
costume, like indeed the Rais himself. To-day the
mother of Essnousee, my friend, was bitten by a scorpion.
I administered Goulard solution to the part, and
gave her fever-powder, as she was very hot and her
belly swollen. She died the next day.</p>

<p>Dined again with the Rais. He says, scorpions are in
great numbers in this city, because it is ancient, and
particularly they abound in the old mosques where the
people do not live or perform domestic matters. "No
person," he added, "is secure from them, and it is all
destined whether we are bitten, and die or not." The
Touarick again assured me that he spoke the truth, he
did not flatter me, by telling me he could take me to
Timbuctoo, when he could not; but yet, if I could make
friends with some respectable merchant of Touat, they
might succeed. A son of the Sheikh Makouran is now
in Timbuctoo. The Sheikh himself gave me a detailed
account of the city; he has been there twice. The old
gentleman, when he had finished his narrative, thought
the time was come for me to assist him. He begged me
to intercede with the British Consul at Tripoli for him,
that he might not be taxed by the Bashaw so much. He
now pays two hundred dollars per annum, assessed taxes.
He assured me that all the money is leaving the country,
and Ghadames will soon be without a para, like the rest
of Tripoli. He told me frankly that he had the idea of
making me a partner in his firm, to get my protection,
but on hearing I was opposed to slave-dealing, it could
not be done, as he and all the merchants were obliged<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-122" id="V1-122"></a>[<a href="./images/1-122.png">122</a>]</span>
to deal in slaves. Indeed, the obstacle of English merchants
joining the Tripoline is at present insuperable, on
account of the slave traffic; if they could unite in one
firm, it would be equally <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'advantangeous'">advantageous</ins> for both parties.</p>

<p><i>2nd.</i>&mdash;Not so many patients this morning. A respectable
Ghadamsee came to me to beg medicine to assist
in conjugal pleasures. I told him to eat, drink, and
take a journey from home for two months.</p>

<p>Although, according to the Italian almanack, the new
moon is on the 1st, yet as the people have not seen it,
there is no Ramadan, (properly <i>Ramtham</i>.) The Rais
says, after the first ten days' keeping the fast it is not
difficult, but, during this period, the adult Mussulmans
suffer exceedingly. Afraid I shall find them all ill-natured
during the fast. Besides, they can't stomach
seeing Infidels eat, whilst they the Faithful fast.</p>

<p>Supped with the Rais. His fowl flew away, and left
him without meat for supper. "<i>Maktoub</i>," he said,
laughing. The Mussulmans are extravagantly fond of
rice, but they never prepare it in that nice delicious way in
which we do, with milk, or in rice pudding. It is always
covered with fat, and soon surfeits one. His Excellency
and his servants played practical jokes on the black dervish.
First, they bastinadoed the dervish, and then he bastinadoed
the Rais's servants. But the dervish did it
in reality, and so effectually, that after two or three
strokes, they jumped up, for he laid it on under all the
force of his witless revenge. When in a passion, or
excited, he speaks his native lingo of Soudan, but when
cool he speaks Arabic and Ghadamsee. He became
mad, <i>en route</i>, by grief in being ravished from his<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-123" id="V1-123"></a>[<a href="./images/1-123.png">123</a>]</span>
country. These practical jokes were played off under
the sanction of his Excellency, before all the people in
the streets.</p>

<p>The prevalent diseases at this season, are diarrh&#339;a and
ophthalmia, with occasional cases of fever. The diarrh&#339;a
arises from the people's eating unripe or bad fruit, particularly
melons, the ophthalmia from frequent exposure
to the sun during the past hot months. The camel-drivers
also bring it into the city, and it is so propagated by infection.
One of my patients is dead, a little boy, afflicted
with diarrh&#339;a for three months. His father, in relating
his death to me, spoke with a resignation which might
be imitated, but could not be surpassed by a Christian.
It is amazing how the thought of all-powerful and resistless
destiny calms the mind, and tones it down to a
speechless patience! My stock of drugs is fast going.
It consisted originally of worm-powders, emetics (of
which the Arabs and Moors are very fond), fever
powders, purgative pills, Epsom salts, compound opium
pills, Goulard powders, eye powders, sulphate of quinine
pills, and solution of nitrate of silver. They were made
up by Dr. Dickson, of Tripoli. I was surprised to find
nothing for pectoral complaints. Many persons here
are troubled with chronic diseases of this sort. Although
administering medicines these eight days to some fifty
persons or more, not one of them has offered me anything
in turn. There are no guinea or five-guinea fees
here. On the contrary, some have asked me for sugar
and money before they could be persuaded to take the
medicine. Such is the consolation of doing good.
Verily the philosopher had it when he said, "Virtue
must be loved for its own sake." Here I may mention<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-124" id="V1-124"></a>[<a href="./images/1-124.png">124</a>]</span>
that the Commandant Omer of our caravan got into a
great passion because I would not buy him a pair of
shoes, and left for The Mountains, without coming to bid
me good bye. He had had coffee and tea, and provisions
always with me, <i>en route</i>, and I thought this
enough. Unless the last favour or request is granted, all
former favours are counted nothing.</p>

<p><i>3rd.</i>&mdash;The morning opens cool and pleasant, and the
heat begins gradually to leave us. People expect rain in
ten days.</p>

<p>Another Touarick has come forward to offer to conduct
me to Timbuctoo. He says now is the time to go,
when it is hot the banditti do not infest the routes, for
they find no water to drink. He offers to take me for
five hundred dollars, which is to be deposited in the
hands of the Sheikh Makouran, and is not to be paid
until our safe return. He will allow me to stop a month
or six weeks in the city of Timbuctoo. The distances of
routes which he gives me, are the same as those on
M. Carette's map, attached to his brochure on the commerce
of The Desert. Of all the French writers who
have recently written on Africa, M. Carette is most
correct. Wrote down a vocabulary of Ghadamsee words
from my turjeman's dictation. Whilst I was lamenting
the little gratitude, or rather none, which the people
showed for my medicines, an old man, to whose mother-in-law
(he having married a woman forty years younger
than himself, frequently the case here,) I gave some
pills, brought me a melon, and said he should bring
also some dates. I was conversing with a group
at the time, and I took the opportunity of observing
that doctors were paid amongst us. An upstart<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-125" id="V1-125"></a>[<a href="./images/1-125.png">125</a>]</span>
man angrily replied:&mdash;"Yes, but we are the chosen
people of God! you Infidels are bound to serve us in
every way, and ought to be thankful that you are so
honoured as to be the servants and slaves of The Moumeneen.
You think you are clever, but your talents
are not your own; your knowledge comes from God."
These affronting words contain a common fanatic sentiment
of Barbary. I made no reply.</p>

<p>Went at noon to visit the Arab suburb, and was a
great curiosity amongst the women and children. Some
of the little girls were frightened out of their wits, but
the boys took up stones to pelt me. The suburb contains
about five hundred souls; the houses are all miserable,
and the people poor. A genuine Ghadamsee
would not live here without being degraded: it is the
St. Giles of the city. Went into a house, the walls of
which were completely concealed beneath the covers for
dishes and meats, bowls and calabashes, the greater part
brought from Soudan. The people were dealers in
them. Talking with the Rais about Soudan, he displayed
the usual ignorance of Mussulmans, even in The
Desert, of this country. It would take a person five
years to travel through that vast country, many parts of
which were populated by cannibals. We read of the
Lemlems, Lamlams, and the Yemyems, as cannibals,
somewhere in the neighbourhood of Zegzeg and Yakobah;
but after conversing with several of the merchants
who have scoured Soudan and Bornou, I have not found
one who has seen these terrible cannibals. They have
all <i>heard</i> of them. It appears to me to be an ancient
tale of wonder to adorn the narratives of travellers.</p>

<p>This evening being that previous to the Ramadan, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-126" id="V1-126"></a>[<a href="./images/1-126.png">126</a>]</span>
great outcry was made to see the moon. According to
my Italian almanack it should be three days' old, the
geographical position of the two countries may make a
difference as to a sight of it. There is a little display of
firing off pistols, chiefly by boys. A vast number of
persons question me, as to whether I shall fast (<i>soum</i>)
to-morrow; and a Touarick goes bolt up to the Governor,
and says, to his Excellency, pointing to where I am
sitting,&mdash;"Does this (man) fast?" His Excellency
shakes his head and laughs gravely. To questions put
direct to me, I answer, "a little." A boy says to me,
"Why, how now, every body fasts, and you don't fast!"
It is, however, prudent to avoid all these questions. I
told some more liberal:&mdash;"The English eat and drink at
all seasons that which is good; but some Christian
nations occasionally fast." According to the Moslemite
rite here observed, all under <i>thirteen</i> may eat during
the Ramadan; but, other authorities tell me, all under
<i>eight</i>. Those who travel are excused for the time being.
The fast endures thirty days. Another patient brought
me a few dates. In time I may alter my opinion of
Ghadamsee gratitude. Some new patients, nearly all
ophthalmia and diarrh&#339;a.</p>

<p>Visited to-day the two wells, which serve a portion of
the population, in addition to the great spring. It is
surprising what an interest I take in water. It is to
me like precious gold, and the most fine gold. One of
these wells has better water than the central running
spring. They are large wells, but do not run like the
great spring: they are also only a little warm. In the
winter they rise higher, showing some connexion with
the rainy season in the <i>rainy</i> region. Two men were<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-127" id="V1-127"></a>[<a href="./images/1-127.png">127</a>]</span>
employed in drawing water in a curious manner. The
other buckets were not being worked. One end of the
shaft is made very heavy, so as to assist in bringing up
the water by over-balancing on a swivel; the other end,
to which the cord and bucket is attached, is correspondingly
light.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill1-06.jpg"><img src="./images/ill1-06_th.jpg" alt="Manner of drawing Water from Wells" title="Manner of drawing Water from Wells" /></a></p>

<p>The houses of Ghadamsee are one, two, three, four, and
even five stories high; the greater part three or four stories.
The architecture is ordinarily Moorish, with some Saharan
fantastic peculiarities. The public buildings offer nothing
remarkable; even the mosques, in a place so devoted to
religion, have no pretty minarets. There are four large
mosques, viz.: Jem&acirc; Kebir,&mdash;Tinghaseen,&mdash;Yerasen,&mdash;Eloweenah;
and many smaller mosques and sanctuaries.
The streets are all covered in and dark, (a peculiarity
prevailing in many Saharan cities,) with here and there
open spaces or little squares, of which there are several
to let in the light of heaven. They are small and nar<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-128" id="V1-128"></a>[<a href="./images/1-128.png">128</a>]</span>row,
and winding, not more than a couple of camels can
pass abreast, the ceiling however being high enough to
admit the entrance of the tall Maharee camel. A camel
of this species entered to-day: it amazed me by its stupendous
height; a person of average size might have
walked under its belly. The principal streets and
squares are lined with stone-benches, on which the
people loungingly recline or stretch themselves. Both
houses and streets are admirably adapted for the climate,
protecting the inhabitants alike from the fiery glare of
the summer's sun, and the keen blasts of the winter's
cold. Before the Rais Mustapha's appointment, the city
had, besides smaller and inner gates, four principal ones,
viz., Bab-el-Manderah, Bab-esh-Shydah, Bab-el-Mishrah,
and Bab-el-Bur ("gate of the country"), all of which,
except the last on the south-west, are now closed, with
respect to the entrance of goods and camels. The city is
situate on the south-east side of the plantations of palms
and gardens, not in the central part of the oasis. I
asked the talebs the meaning of some of the names of
the gates, but they could not tell. Many proper names of
places and persons, amongst them as with us, have now
no assignable meaning or derivation.</p>

<p><i>4th.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Walked</span> out this morning and found no one in
the streets; every body was still in bed, or shut up in
their houses, being the first day of the Ramadan. A
paralysis of death seemed to have stricken the city.
Had no morning patients for the same reason. Afterwards,
the servants of the Rais came to visit me and
found me taking coffee; they gaped with full (empty?)
open mouths, as if wondering I was not choked. I
asked them if the Rais would take his tea. "It's unlawful,"
they screamed, and ran away as if Old Nick were
after them. Usually make tea for the Governor every
morning, which I send him in a glass, and sometimes
also for the Sheikh Makouran. I could not help thanking
God that I was born a Protestant, and professed a
religion not in violence to the physical requirements of
human nature, nor in contradiction to the plain sense of<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-130" id="V1-130"></a>[<a href="./images/1-130.png">130</a>]</span>
mankind. Man has evils enough to contend with, and
to war against, without inflicting new and additional evils
upon himself, like this most health-trying and health-destroying
Ramadan. My turjeman confessed every
body was mad in Ramadan. Whatever becomes of me
in the deserts of Africa, I hope I shall have force of
mind enough to maintain my religion intact.</p>

<p>I amused myself with thinking how the Desert-travelling
might be considerably shortened. This could be
effected by joining camels with horses through the routes.
Horses could come easily from Tripoli to The Mountains
in two days. The camels could undertake the journey
from The Mountains to Seenawan in three or four days.
Horses then could again accomplish the rest in two days.
In all, <i>seven</i> days. Were Europeans in possession of
this country, horses and mules would soon take the place
of camels, for all quick travelling. Putting aside horses,
by the use of the <i>maharee</i>, or fleet-camel, the journey
for post could be reduced nearly half. All the Moors
and Arabs dissuade me against going to Timbuctoo,
assuring me that the Touaricks will cut my throat; but
I begin to feel my opinion changing as to the Touaricks.
I am sure, if a friend can be made of a brave man of
this nation, there is no danger. Am glad, however,
people manifest some sympathy with my travelling projects;
what I want to do is, to effect some real discovery,
or do something great in Africa. Ghadames is not
enough, nor even Bornou; it is, must be, Timbuctoo.
Yet a man must not put his head into the fire and then
call upon God to quench the flames. Met Sheikh Makouran
in the street, and brought him home to my house
in order that he might give me a more detailed account<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-131" id="V1-131"></a>[<a href="./images/1-131.png">131</a>]</span>
of the finances of Ghadames. Notwithstanding that
the Turks overturn and ruin commerce by restrictions,
they poorly protect the merchants. The Sheikh complained
to me of several losses. During the last two
years four ghafalahs had been plundered on different
routes, by which he lost considerable sums. Other merchants
lost property in proportion. He considered
Ghadames, from various causes, fast approaching its
ruin. Our conversation then turned to the New World,
America. He was quite astonished at my description
of it, and asked if any Mohammedans were there. We
then came to the traffic in slaves. He did not see why
men should not be sold like camels and asses, if such
was the law of God. "All," he observed, "depended
upon the will of the Creator of all beings."</p>

<p>The Rais is a very religious man, and I'm cautious
what I say. At noon, paid him a visit, and said, "Why,
all the people are dead to day." He replied, "It's only
for one day." I never saw a poor devil look so comfortless.
He is an inveterate, eternal smoker, like all
who boast to be of the same nation as the Imperial
Osmanlis, the pipe is never out of his mouth; he therefore
suffers more than any person in Ghadames. He
was still busy, or affected to be, to kill time, weighing
gold with his servants. I said, "Is there much gold in
the country?" "Less and less every year," was the
reply. Many caravans go by way of Mourzuk, not
coming this way. The servant held up the little bags,
showing that the gold, not more than two or three
ounces, belonged to <i>four</i> persons. When gold is brought
over The Desert, it is tied up in little dirty filthy bits
of rags, first twisted round where it opens, and then<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-132" id="V1-132"></a>[<a href="./images/1-132.png">132</a>]</span>
tied. These are carried on the person, in the bosom or
the turban.</p>

<p>When a caravan is attacked and the people rifled, all
these little bags of rags, whether containing gold, or salt,
pepper, essences, or what not, are scrupulously cut open
by the brigands. The gold brought to Ghadames consists
chiefly of women's ear-rings, hoop and drop ear-rings.
Some of the drops are hollow and contain little
matters which rattle, and perfumed with small quantities
of atar, or of zebed, (civet). The workmanship is rude
and clumsy, but the gold is of the finest quality, though
small and unpolished, something as the Malta gold is
worked. The Rais collects the gold from those who
cannot pay in the current coin. The gold country of
the merchants is not very distinctly understood by them.
Some say it is <i>fouk</i>, "above," Timbuctoo, others beyond
Jinnee and Bambara, about three months from Timbuctoo,
in a south-west direction. The country is called
Mellee, which includes many large districts and provinces,
but the particular district is <i>Furra</i>. This is a flat and
sandy place, "not a stone," say the merchants, "is to
be seen." The mines of Furra, if such they may be
called, are sold by auction, and the lot of land is a lot
of fortune, some plots producing nothing, others gold in
abundance. When the gold arrives at Timbuctoo, it is
converted into women's ornaments, mostly ear-rings. I
have seen very few bags of gold-dust or bars. There are
no camel-caravans from Timbuctoo to Mellee and Furra;
people go in small parties on horses and asses; some go
alone on foot. Foot-travelling is very common in Central
Africa; and these pedestrian merchants or pedlars will
make journeys of three and four months. A merchant<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-133" id="V1-133"></a>[<a href="./images/1-133.png">133</a>]</span>
is obliged to remain some time before he can buy up any
quantity of gold; it is brought in such small quantities,
and the trade in gold is declining, and has been so for
twenty years past. It is probable the merchants take
more of it now to the western coast and its European
factories. Certainly that route is safer than bringing it
north, over several months' journey of Desert.</p>

<p>The Rais is a most diligent servant of Government.
One cannot help observing, however, that the whole
scope and end of governing with the Osmanlis is&mdash;<i>money</i>.
Of the people, their protection and improvement,
they rarely ever think. As the Rais is now busy
in making every body book up, some people asked me if
there was much money in Tripoli? I told them I did
not think there was any money left. "The Pasha has
plenty," cried one. I took the trouble of explaining the
new system, that each functionary had a salary, granted
by the Sultan, from the highest to the lowest, and the
Deftadar, after paying each his salary, sent the rest of
the money to Constantinople, where (as the Rais himself
said) it was "poured away as water." Perhaps this
was speaking too freely, but the Moslemites at times
speak uncommonly free and bold for despotic governments.
The Bey of Tunis has often been menaced with
hell-fire by the Arabs, when they pleaded before him in
the hall of judgment, swearing, that if he did not deal
to them justice, God would deal to him vengeance.</p>

<p>The use of different terms is very curious in travelling
through North Africa, and each country has its peculiar
Arabic word, the words being all more or less classical.
Perhaps no word is so much used in Ghadames and The
Mountains as the epithet <i>batel</i>&mdash;&#8238;&#1576;&#1575;&#1591;&#1604;&#8236;&mdash;"vain, useless,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-134" id="V1-134"></a>[<a href="./images/1-134.png">134</a>]</span>
&amp;c., and really answers in its use to something like our
tremendous "Humbug." It especially denotes everything
bad, false, and wrong, in any matter and in any
body. On the contrary, for the opposite epithet, various
terms are used, "<i>maleah</i>," "tayeb," and "<i>zain</i>," which
latter term always means pretty, as well as good. The
polite Ghadamseeah are very fond of <i>zain</i>; but it should
properly apply to pretty women. The people use the
term &#8238;&#1588;&#1607;&#1585;&#8236; "month," for moon, instead of <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads '&#8238;&#1602;&#1605;&#8236;'">&#8238;&#1602;&#1605;&#1585;&#8236;</ins>. The &#8238;&#1602;&#8236;
is not distinguished in pronunciation from &#8238;&#1594;&#8236;, and I have
not attempted it in writing. Indeed, I shall avoid as
much as possible distinctions which the generality of
readers cannot understand.</p>

<p>Only one of my patients came to-day, the little blind
boy. The Rais sent me in the evening a fine dish and
soup, on occasion of the night of the first day's fasting.
The people kept to-night as an <i>&acirc;yed</i> or feast. A Touarick
took Said, my servant, aside, and whispered mysteriously
in his ear,&mdash;"Has the Christian fasted to-day?"
Speaking to a liberal Moor, I told him the fast was
<i>b&#259;t&#257;l</i>, inasmuch as the Mussulmans ate all night and
slept the greater portion of the day, making things equal;
that to fast really, as some Christians did, was to eat
nothing, night or day. At the time I added, "I am
not such a fool as to increase the miseries of this life by
fasting when I can get anything to eat." The fellow,
laughing, observed, "You English are right." I see the
fast is nearly universal, old and young, rich and poor,
high and low, all fast. They mix with it strong religious
feelings, and I dare say fanaticism, a quality rarely
apart from the purest religious sentiment. Still continue
our conversations on Timbuctoo. Most of the old respect<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-135" id="V1-135"></a>[<a href="./images/1-135.png">135</a>]</span>able
merchants have been to Timbuctoo. One of them, Haj
Mansour, resided there fourteen years, carrying on a
prosperous trade. But so perverse and unstable are
human affairs, that, on returning home after so long an
exile, with thirty camels laden with the riches of the
interior, and with much fine gold, and whilst within a
few days of Touat, the banditti of The Desert fell upon
him and carried off everything, not leaving a water-skin
to quench his thirst! Had he not been near Touat, he
would have perished in The Desert. The Haj is quite
black, though his features are not Negro. He is now an
old gentleman of upwards of seventy, and yet very
active. His family is immense; what with women, and
girls, and sons, and grandsons, it musters some thirty
souls. He told me with bitterness, as if it had been
the case with himself, the merchants were often their
own enemies, they were so parsimonious that they would
not hire a sufficient escort of Touaricks, and so left
defenceless in The Desert many were plundered and
ruined irretrievably. The greatest misfortune in travelling
through the country of the Touaricks is, their chiefs
have not sufficient power to control the people, and for
whose actions they will not always be responsible. One
day you may meet with the best of men amongst the
Touaricks, the next day with a band of robbers; such
is the uncertainty and insecurity of The Desert.</p>

<p><i>5th.</i>&mdash;It would be a good project at least, and might
be attended with incalculable benefit, in promoting
Christianity and civilization in Africa, were portions of
The Scriptures translated into Touarick, with the native
Touarick characters. Their vanity would be so exceedingly
excited that it would be almost impossible for them<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-136" id="V1-136"></a>[<a href="./images/1-136.png">136</a>]</span>
to refuse reading a book written in their own dear characters.
All can read their own characters, but very
few the Arabic. It is not a little surprising, if I am to
believe what I hear, that the Touaricks, with all their
savage boldness&mdash;whose home is The Desert&mdash;will not
venture on a journey to Tripoli. Many, many times have
they been persuaded and pressed by the coast merchants,
but they have always set their faces against the journey.
Perhaps they think (as some, indeed, hinted to me) the
Pasha would keep them prisoners, and not let them
return until they had delivered up some of their districts
to his authority. Whatever the motive, it is strange
that men, who wander through all parts of Central
Africa, cannot be prevailed upon to visit Tripoli. I
have heard but of one exception.</p>

<p>It is pleasant to witness the least sign of improvement
in a people who are commonly condemned by their own
habits, their religion, and the opinions of Europeans, to
a retrograde or eternally stationary existence. I was
much pleased to observe in one of the small squares of
the city a tree recently planted, (the <i>tout</i><a name="FNa_1-23" id="FNa_1-23"></a><a href="#FoN_1-23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>, a species of
small white mulberry,) which promises to afford not only
a grateful shade to repose under in summer's burning
heat, but is in itself a pretty ornament. The great fault
of the Africans is want of forethought, or impatience of
the future. Their maxim is, to enjoy the present, to
take no thought for the morrow, but let the morrow
provide for itself. Like all rude and unlettered people,
the precepts of religion are interpreted in their strictest
literality. To-day, I find more people in the streets,<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-137" id="V1-137"></a>[<a href="./images/1-137.png">137</a>]</span>
and the Ramadan is not so visible in their faces as I
expected it would be. The fact is, the generality of the
Saharan inhabitants, and especially the poor Arabs eat
but once, or make but one meal a day, and this in the
evening; so, in reality, as far as eating is concerned, the
Ramadan is no Ramadan with them. Saw the Rais,
he is better than yesterday. His Excellency called me
a simpleton for talking with the Touaricks about going
to Timbuctoo; nevertheless, I feel as if I should like to
go the whole-hog&mdash;Timbuctoo, or nothing. The future
will tell! His Excellency, however, observed, that the
Touaricks of Touat had nearly destroyed all the
banditti on the route of Timbuctoo. It is the interest
of the Touaricks to keep the routes free that they
may have the advantage of the visits and escorting of
caravans.</p>

<p>One of the peculiarities of Ghadames is that there is
no Jew resident in the city. It is strange that a people
of such a commercial genius as the Israelites should never
have had courage to undertake an enterprize over The
Great Desert, whilst they have crept all around it. In
Tunis they are scattered throughout the Jereed; in
Algeria they are established at the oases of Souf and
Mezab; in Morocco we find them at Sous and Wadnoun;
and in Tripoli they are located in nearly every town
of the coast, whilst a few visit The Mountains. But, to the
credit of the Jews and their mercantile genius, it is not
their fault. The fanaticism of the Ghadamsee people
would be strongly opposed to their residence here, more
so than against Christians; it is enough to support the
overbearing Christian <i>kafer</i>, without the pollution of the
weak miserable Jew in their holy city, for the <i>force</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-138" id="V1-138"></a>[<a href="./images/1-138.png">138</a>]</span>
principle makes the Mohammedans respect the Christians.
The weak are despised, the strong respected. I
might, however, have made the experiment of bringing a
Jewish servant here: one sadly wanted to come with me.
Still a traveller should not unnecessarily increase his
difficulties, and excite the prejudices of the people
amongst whom he resides, mostly by sufferance. It is
probable also the mercantile jealousy of the people would
be excited against the Jews. Afterwards I learnt that
two <i>Barbary</i> Jews went either to Bornou or Soudan, in
the year 1844, and returned safe. Unfortunately this
species of Jew can add nothing to our stock of geographical
knowledge beyond what we may get from the
Arabs and Moors themselves; his ideas of nature and
science are all the same, with the exception of a few
religious dogmas, and a strong national bias. The visit
of these two Jews to Bornou excited no attention in
Tripoli. Along the line of The Desert the Jews help
commerce. They are great ostrich-feather merchants in
Southern Morocco. Some have said they go to Timbuctoo,
but this report is not authenticated. In Souf
they greatly assist the Arabs in the exchange of their
products. About twenty families are established amongst
the Sou&#257;fah, in the greatest security of life and property.
The Jews here dress like the Arabs, and are not easily
distinguishable from them. In most of the interior districts
they have the privilege of dressing like the rest of
the people.</p>

<p>The Rais is an old bachelor, like myself. He seems
to live very wretchedly without a wife. The good Mussulmans,
who think it a sin to live unmarried, excuse him
because his residence in different parts of the regency<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-139" id="V1-139"></a>[<a href="./images/1-139.png">139</a>]</span>
is uncertain, and he tells them he cannot lead about
a wife. The only object of affection of this bachelor is
a parrot, which speaks pure Housa lingo, and is very
angry at the gruff tones of the Touraghee language,
always scolding the Touaricks when they speak.</p>

<p>My Marabout camel-driver once had an interesting
conversation with me about a plurality of wives:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is not right to have more wives than one, because
men and women are nearly equally in numbers, and if
one man has two wives another man must go without
even one."</p>

<p><i>The Marabout.</i>&mdash;"Oh, if a man has money, he may
have two, or three, or four?"</p>

<p>"That is not a good religion which gives four wives to
one man because he has money, and leaves another man
without any because he has no money, or not so much
money as his neighbour."</p>

<p><i>The Marabout.</i>&mdash;"So it is," (as if convinced of the
reasonableness of the thing).</p>

<p>"Why has such an old man as Sheikh Makouran two
young wives? This is against nature."</p>

<p><i>The Marabout.</i>&mdash;"He plays; his time of work is past."</p>

<p>I believe this unequal distribution of the women is
a great check on population. It prevails to a greater
extent amongst the Negro tribes. I am not of opinion
that Central Africa is populous. I saw nowhere any
populous districts myself.</p>

<p>The wood used in the construction of buildings is that
of the date-tree, which, apparently, grows stronger and
tougher with age. Of this all the doors of the houses
and the lighter works are made. Wood for fireing
is brought in from The Sahara, but from a great distance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-140" id="V1-140"></a>[<a href="./images/1-140.png">140</a>]</span>
It is sold for three Tunisian piastres the camel-load. It
is the common brush-wood, underwood, or scrub of The
Desert, and is excessively dry, for withered and dead
trees or shrubs are gathered. In seasons of rain The
Sahara creates this wood quickly, it then perishes for
want of rain. Sometimes wood for building is brought
from Tripoli, <i>i. e.</i>, deal-boards. Our caravan brought
some doors for a mosque, made of deal.</p>

<p>This evening was a grand celebration of divine worship
in the house of the Rais, and a Marabout chanted
verses from the Koran. His Excellency certainly gains
the respect, if not the affections, of the pious. He is
often said by the people to be a man who "fears God."
I sat near the door listening. A fellow said to me,
"You must sit farther off whilst the people are praying,
it is unlawful to sit where you are." I took no notice of
his impertinence. The Rais sent me yesterday, as the
evening before, a very good supper. Being Ramadan, I
stopped up till midnight talking politics with him. He is
a native of a province, near Circassia, fallen under the iron
rule of Muskou (the Russians). Having been in the Syrian
campaign he was enabled to see the <i>feeding</i> of the
English soldiers and sailors, which quite astonished him.
He observed, "The Emperor of Russia will never have
good troops, he scarcely gives them anything to eat. It
is not surprising they desert to the Circassians." The
Rais has a great dread of the Russians absorbing the
Ottoman empire: it is not an unreasonable dread.</p>

<p><i>6th.</i>&mdash;My turjeman complains that neither he nor the
people can pay their excessive taxes; they must all be
soon ruined. Yet a couple of thousand pounds per
annum is nothing for a commercial city like this. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-141" id="V1-141"></a>[<a href="./images/1-141.png">141</a>]</span>
says, "If we were to cultivate our gardens, we should
have more; but then the Turks would demand more, so
our spirits are broken, and we are eaten up. We have no
heart to work for our oppressors." Continue to read the
Arabic New Testament, which aids me in colloquial disquisitions
with the people. The Ghadamsee people
persist in not taking medicines during the fast. One
told me, "Even if a man dies, and medicine could save
him, he must not take it." I have therefore fewer patients
during the inexorable Ramadan. But I <i>save</i> my tea and
coffee&mdash;"An ill wind blows, &amp;c." The Rais, however,
gets his tea in the evening. It is remarkable with what
willingness, and without any sort of prejudice, several
of the people offer me information. Even when refused,
I always find it arises from indolence to narrate it. They
are not afraid that I am collecting information to supply
the English Government with the means of invading
their country, like some Moors in Barbary. They look
upon the thing just as it is,&mdash;that I am writing a book
about their country to amuse Christians.</p>

<p>The Sheikh of the slaves came in, with several Ghadamsee
youths:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Governor says, you are not the Sheikh; <i>he</i> is the
Sheikh."</p>

<p>"So, does he say?"</p>

<p>(<i>The Youths.</i>&mdash;"But the Sheikh <i>is</i> the Sheikh.")</p>

<p>"I am," says the Sheikh, "from Timbuctoo; all the
people are Mohammedans, and fast. Do you fast?"</p>

<p><i>I.</i>&mdash;"I eat and drink what is good at all times, even
wild-boar."</p>

<p><i>The Sheikh and Youths.</i>&mdash;"Oh, wonderful!"</p>

<p><i>They.</i>&mdash;"You write Arabic?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-142" id="V1-142"></a>[<a href="./images/1-142.png">142</a>]</span></p>

<p>I wrote that God was <i>one</i>.</p>

<p><i>They.</i>&mdash;"And write Mahomet was the Prophet of
God?"</p>

<p>I wrote Mahomet was the Prophet of the Arabs and
the Touaricks?</p>

<p><i>The Sheikh.</i>&mdash;"Ah, ah, I see, I see, you're very cunning."</p>

<p><i>The Youths.</i>&mdash;"Who is your Prophet?"</p>

<p><i>I.</i>&mdash;"Aysa (Jesus)."</p>

<p><i>The Youths.</i>&mdash;"Have you any books of your Prophet?"</p>

<p><i>I.</i>&mdash;"Yes, here is one:" (Giving them the New Testament.)</p>

<p><i>They.</i>&mdash;"Oh, see, let us read it, let us take it home."</p>

<p><i>I.</i>&mdash;"No; if you were men, yes. But if I allow you
to read it, or read it to you, your Bey and the people
will be offended with me, and send me out of the city.
When you go to Tripoli, you can see and read the Christian
books."</p>

<p>I was surprised that a well-informed man like the
Sheikh Makouran should ask me whether the Emperor of
Morocco was also Emperor of Fez, and whether Morocco
was a large country. "Ghat," says the Rais, "like all
the Touarick countries, is a republic. All the people
govern." Walked out this evening for the first time to-day.
The people are vehement in their complaints
against the oppressions of the Turks: "All the wealth
of the country is dried up, and the merchants are all
running away. We are ruined unless the English save us."</p>

<p>It has been very hot and sultry to-day. Not a
breath of air. The sky overcast&mdash;a profound, deathlike
tranquillity sleeping over the environs! The Rais sent
supper as usual. After visiting him, he had a fit of<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-143" id="V1-143"></a>[<a href="./images/1-143.png">143</a>]</span>
writing, and wrote for the courier all night. Thank
God, there are no gnats in Ghadames. I have not seen
nor felt any. It is probably owing to the absence of
<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'water no'">no</ins>no water, stagnating here, all being absorbed in the
dry earth of the gardens.</p>

<p><i>7th.</i>&mdash;Read eight chapters of the Arabic Testament.
Some of the phrases very strangely rendered into
Arabic. The Moors cannot understand them. My
Testament wants some verses: it is the ordinary Arabic
Bible circulated by The Bible Society. There is no
good translation of The Scriptures into Arabic, from
what I have been able to learn. Continue to think
all day long and dream of Timbuctoo. Had a conversation
with the Touaricks about a journey there. The
difficulty is, the strongest Touarick escort practicable
cannot always pass through the Touarick districts, there
being such a great variety of tribes. It is the quarrels
of the Touaricks themselves, and not our not being able
to trust them individually, which renders the route so
dangerous.</p>

<p>Slave-dealing is so completely engendered in the
minds of the Ghadamsee merchants, that they cannot
conceive how it can be wrong. A young man wrote me
down the objects (very few) of exportation from Soudan,
and in the following order, viz., "Cottons, elephants'
teeth, <i>bekhour</i> (perfume), wax, slaves, bullocks' skins, red
skins, feathers, (of the ostrich)." Human beings are
just summed up with the rest as an article of commerce,
as a matter of course, in the most mercantile
style.</p>

<p>It will be next to impossible to propagate anti-slavery
notions in Central Africa, supported as slavery is<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-144" id="V1-144"></a>[<a href="./images/1-144.png">144</a>]</span>
by commerce and religion. We can only say, "With
God nothing is impossible."</p>

<p>All the people bring their griefs and malcontentments
to me. It's not so pleasant to be bored by them, let
alone the policy of my listening to all they have to say.
But the ill humour of these poor fleeced people must
have a vent, or <i>sfogo</i>, as the Italians term it, and what
can I do? An intelligent merchant came to me.
"Y&acirc;kob, <i>bisslamah</i>, (how do you fare?) The Rais is
always collecting money, don't you see? That's the
business of the Turks. This city is 4000 years of age.
It flourished before Pharaoh, in the time of Nimrod.
Now the Turks come to destroy it; their business is to
destroy; such is the will of God." I might elaborate the
idea. The genius of the Turks is to destroy. The
hand of the Turk blasts as mildew everything it touches;
it has destroyed the fairest portions of the earth. Happily,
however, it so destroys itself, for it is not desirable
for truth and civilization that the sway of the Osmanlis
should be restored to its pristine strength.</p>

<p>Among the most friendly people to me in Ghadames
are the Arab soldiers. Now, whilst I write, not less
than twenty of these poor fellows are lying around my
door, and in the <i>skeefah</i> (entrance-passage or room) of
my house. They tell me always, my house is their
house, and their mountains my mountains. They all
speak in the highest terms of Mr. Frederick Warrington,
son of Colonel Warrington, whom they call <i>Fredreek</i>.
They consider him as one of themselves, and so he is as
to habits, manners, and language, and frequently dress.
When they quarrel in Tripoli, the ultima ratio, or dernier
ressort, is not to go to the Pasha, but <i>Nimshee lel</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-145" id="V1-145"></a>[<a href="./images/1-145.png">145</a>]</span>
<i>Fredreek</i>, "Let us go to Frederick!" This is "the
settler." It has often been said amongst the Consular
corps of Tripoli, that, in case Great Britain thought it
expedient to assume the Protectorate of Tripoli, Frederick
Warrington would be their man, the instrument of
revolution. There is not a single Arab in the Regency
but what would flock to his standard. He has been all
his lifetime in Tripoli.</p>

<p>M. Carette, in his brochure of the <i>Commerce of Central
Africa</i>, says, "Timbaktou, K&acirc;nou, et Noufi sont les trois
march&eacute;s principaux du pays des Noirs. Les voyageurs
du Nord ne parlent pas du Niger; c'est une limite qu'ils
ne franchissent pas; ils paraissent n'avoir aucunes relations
avec les populations Mandingues de la rive droite:"
(p. 26). This is inexact. The merchants do speak of the
Niger frequently to me, calling it the <i>Wady Neel</i>, thinking,
and which is a very ancient opinion, that it is a
continuation of the Nile of Egypt. They also visit the
opposite shores or banks of the Mandingoes. Some of
them go to Noufi, as M. Carette admits; on my leaving
for Ghat, a merchant going to Noufi was my fellow
traveller, and promised to accompany me there. Here
Mr. Becroft has recently, from the south-east, ascending
the Niger, shaken hands with the merchants of the
north. An old slave, a native of <i>Sansandee</i> (or <i>Sinsindee</i>
&#8238;&#1587;&#1606;&#1587;&#1606;&#1583;&#1610;&#8236;) says of the Niger, "The river is like the sea
of Tripoli and all sweet" (water.)</p>

<p>The Sheikh Makouran does not approve of my Timbuctoo
ideas. Says the city is always in an uproar with
the Touaricks, who are robbers and not like the Touaricks
of Touat. Walked through the town at noon, and met
Essnousee, had not seen him for some time, and wondered<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-146" id="V1-146"></a>[<a href="./images/1-146.png">146</a>]</span>
what had become of him. He was very friendly, and
wanted to bring me lemonade in the street. But as
there was a large concourse of people present, all fasting,
poor devils, at this time of the day; I thought common
decency required me to go with him to his house. I
waited in a dark corner close by his door, and here I
quaffed the forbidden draught in the high-noon of the
Fast. He smiled at me when I finished, and said, "Well
done, Y&acirc;kob." He gave me also a fine melon to bring
home with me. I considered this feat of drinking
lemonade, under the circumstance related, a remarkable
trait of tolerance. People usually put into their lemonade
pieces of rag steeped in lemon-juice and dried;
in this way the juice is preserved from evaporation.
Essnousee had just lost his wife. "Have you any other
wives?" I said. "Oh yes," he replied, "one here and
one in Ghat." Many of the merchants, like the roving
tar who has a sweetheart at every port, have a wife at
every city of The Desert and Soudan where they trade.
Several of the children now in Ghadames were born
either in Timbuctoo or Soudan.</p>

<p><i>8th.</i>&mdash;Few patients on account of the Ramadan.
Weather extremely sultry. People bear the fast remarkably
well, and with good humour enough. The Rais
persists in sending me supper though I would rather he
did not. After mass and chanting prayers in the evening,
his Excellency holds a court. He abused the Sultan
of Constantinople and called him an ass for spending his
money like a fool, and this license before all the people!
Smoking, drinking coffee, talking, and writing for the
courier, all together, so his Excellency passes his Ramadan
evenings. Said, my negro servant, is becoming as great<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-147" id="V1-147"></a>[<a href="./images/1-147.png">147</a>]</span>
a man as his master in Ghadames. He receives visits
from all the slaves of the city, as well as the free negroes.
Being slaves, I am very indulgent, and sometimes they
stop all day with him. The slaves of the Touaricks also
come. Said manages to talk with them all in all
languages. I see there is a sort of free-masonry amongst
negroes, and they all (which is greatly to their credit)
stick close to one another, and take one another's part.
Said is impatient about his <i>&acirc;tka</i>, or freedom ticket. He
said to me to-day&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, Sidi, where's my &acirc;tka? The people will steal
me and sell me again."</p>

<p>"No, Said," I replied, "have patience, if they steal
you, they must steal me also."</p>

<p>Visited with Said to-day "the Street of Slaves."
This is a little dark street appropriated for the rendezvous
of the slaves in my part of the city, where they
enjoy the cool of the evening and chat together. I
squatted down to chat amongst them, which awakened
their curiosity.</p>

<p>"Who's that naked boy there?"</p>

<p><i>They.</i>&mdash;"The Touaricks brought him from Bornou."</p>

<p>"What are they going to do with him?"</p>

<p><i>They.</i>&mdash;"The Touaricks will send him to Tripoli, and
sell him; will you buy him?"</p>

<p>"No, no; if I buy him, my sultan will put me in
prison."</p>

<p>(<i>They</i>, one to the other.&mdash;"Do you believe him?")</p>

<p>"The English had many slaves, but gave them all
the <i>&acirc;tka</i>; and soon, please God, they will destroy slavery
in all the world."<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-148" id="V1-148"></a>[<a href="./images/1-148.png">148</a>]</span></p>

<p><i>They.</i>&mdash;"Ah, ah," (laughing), "that's right; we wish
to have the <i>&acirc;tka</i>."</p>

<p>I found some were from Soudan, others from Timbuctoo,
the greater part from Bornou. About a score
of them were present; their greatest delight was in
exchanging their various lingos. When they heard I
was going to Kanou, one jumped up like a fury, saying,
"Oh, I must send something to my mother." This was
a poor grey-headed wrinkled-faced old man! His poor
mother, alas! may have been long ago whipped to death
upon the cotton plantations of South Carolina, where
the blood of the slave is poured out to fertilize the fields
of pampered republicans, and give tongue to the braggadocio
of the free sons of the Model-Republic!</p>

<p>To-day, saw three swallows in a garden for the first
time at Ghadames. They darted over the heads and
through the foliage of the graceful palms, performing
sweet eccentric circles. To me, they were winged messengers
from the fair bowers and silvery brooks of
Paradise.</p>

<p>To give an idea of the general ignorance of the Ghadamsee
people on European geography, I have only to
record a part of a conversation with them.</p>

<p><i>They.</i>&mdash;"Where's your country; is it near Rome?"</p>

<p>"No; further to the west and north."</p>

<p><i>They.</i>&mdash;"Did not the English spring from the Arabs?"</p>

<p>"No; the English are from the north, a colder
country; the Arabs are from a hot country."</p>

<p><i>They.</i>&mdash;"Are the Greeks like the English? and is
their country near yours?"</p>

<p>"No; they are farther from us than Rome itself."<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-149" id="V1-149"></a>[<a href="./images/1-149.png">149</a>]</span></p>

<p><i>They.</i>&mdash;"Do the English fast?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes; but when they fast they don't eat in
the night time, like you; they fast day and night."</p>

<p><i>They.</i>&mdash;"That's not good; that's not right. Do you
fast?"</p>

<p>"Never, thank God."</p>

<p>The people bother my life out about fasting. Two
young Touarick women came to me&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thou Christian! dost thou fast?" (they having never
seen a person before who did not fast).</p>

<p>"No; the Christians don't fast."</p>

<p><i>The girls.</i>&mdash;"Don't the Christians know God?"</p>

<p>"Yes, they know God."</p>

<p><i>The girls.</i>&mdash;"No, they don't, for they don't say Mahomet
is the prophet of God."</p>

<p>The sum of religion amongst many of the wild tribes,
is the formula of Mahomet being the prophet of God&mdash;fasting
and circumcision. Many of the Touaricks, however,
will not fast, or fast with difficulty, it involving the
cessation of smoking, of which they are passionately fond.
A Touarick, who was accustomed to visit Mr. Gagliuffi
at Mourzuk, ridiculed the Ramadan, and called those
who fasted, fools. He would squat down in Mr. Gagliuffi's
house, and take out his pipe at midday, and say,
"Come, Consul, let's have a <i>drink</i> of the pipe. These
people who fast all day are asses." Other Touaricks,
more scrupulous, always set out on a journey during
Ramadan, in order to have the relaxation permitted by
the law.</p>

<p>The Rais is deeply engaged in petty finance, some
quite mites, to make up the accounts for Tripoli. Whilst
seated near his Excellency, a big lout of a fellow was<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-150" id="V1-150"></a>[<a href="./images/1-150.png">150</a>]</span>
brought up, charged with beating a little urchin, who
was present to substantiate the charge. The Rais, after
gravely hearing the case, had the big clown turned round
with his hands tied behind him, and then told the little
rogue aggrieved to lay it into him as hard as he could
with his fists clenched. The little imp, who looked as
wicked as imp could be, instantly gave the broad back
of the great fellow half a dozen strokes. Hereupon all
the bystanders, and the officers of his Excellency, burst
into a fit of tremendous laughter, and the big coward
was allowed to escape, sneaking off like a dog with his
tail between his legs. The Rais came up to me smiling
with great self-complacency, and said&mdash;"Well, isn't that
the way to administer justice?" I then astonished the
hangers-on of his Excellency's Court, by relating to them
some account of the expeditions to the North Pole.
They asked me whether any Mussulmans were there,
and how they could fast when the sun did not set?
Several said I merely invented the account to amuse
them. In this case, and also in that of the precepts of
the Mosaic Institute, we see the inconvenience of making
the precepts of religion depend on local and physical
circumstances.</p>

<p>I have seen little urchins in Italy, before the flaming
wax-light altars, drink in with their mother's milk the
virus of Popery, but I never witnessed a stronger case of
infantile prejudice than to-day. A child of less than
three years old came running out of a by-street (apparently
no person being near it), and called after me,
<i>Kafer, kafer</i>, "Infidel, infidel"! and spat at me in the
bargain like a little toad.</p>

<p>Noon.&mdash;I met with a fellow, a sort of swaggering<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-151" id="V1-151"></a>[<a href="./images/1-151.png">151</a>]</span>
cheap-jack penny-a-liner, who swore that there was no
man so learned as himself in all Ghadames, and that
he would teach me the history of Ghadames, and all
the world, <i>for money</i>. He then followed me home,
asked me for my journal, and wrote in it five lines of
Arabic poetry. Meanwhile I poured him out a cup of
tea, putting a large lump of sugar in it. When he
had finished his five lines, which he did without being
asked, he impudently demanded a dollar for his trouble.
I told some Arabs who were present to turn him out of
the house. He decamped, but not before giving us his
blessing&mdash;"The curse of God be upon you Arab dogs,
and the Christian dog."</p>

<p>Awfully hot to-day. The hottest day since my residence
in Ghadames. Yet, strange to say, when shut up
in my room, I feel very little of it. My house is only
one story high; there is only a single roof between me
and this sun of fire&mdash;a strong proof of how little is
necessary to protect you from the heats of The Sahara.
Late at night, when sitting with the Rais, he amused me
with pulling off his greegrees or talismans. As he
pulled off each he kissed it devoutly, and laid it by
gently on his papers. He wears one round his arm in
the shape of an armlet, and three round his neck, two
suspended with separate ribbons, and one with a silver
chain. As he kissed each, he put it to his eyes, rubbing
it over the eyelid. I am sadly afraid his charms obtain
all the credit of my solution of nitrate of silver. Be it
so; it is hard to cure men of this sort of folly, at best
a most unwished, unrequited labour<a name="FNa_1-24" id="FNa_1-24"></a><a href="#FoN_1-24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>. I always tell the<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-152" id="V1-152"></a>[<a href="./images/1-152.png">152</a>]</span>
Ghadamsee people the medicine I distribute neither
belongs to me, nor to the English Consul at Tripoli, but
to the Queen of England, and which, I have observed,
heightens its value in their eyes. <i>Douwa min, &acirc;nd
Sultana Ingleeza</i>, ("physic from the English Sultana",) is
a sort of royal talisman which helps the medicine down
as a bit of sugar taken with a child's draught.</p>

<p><i>10th.</i>&mdash;The women brought several little children, all
ailing, but could do very little for them. Occupied
writing most of the day. Spent the evening with the
Rais. His Excellency is very fond of politics: "The
Touaricks number more than two hundred thousand souls.
They are dispersed over all The Desert. The Sahara
is not so difficult to occupy as some think; it can be
more easily conquered than the mountainous districts.
The country is more open. The only difficulty is the
wells. But in winter, the time when military expeditions
are undertaken, there is water on the line of most
of the grand routes, and camels can supply a large
body of compact troops, where there are no wells. At
the different wells small forts could be built, like that I
am building at <i>Emjezzem</i>, which forts the Touaricks
would never dare approach. The wells once in possession
of the invading force, it would be impossible for
any considerable body of Arabs or Touaricks to follow
up or after their steps. Twenty thousand men could
occupy, in detachments, the greater part of The Sahara.
The French will go to Touat one day, not yet!" But<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-153" id="V1-153"></a>[<a href="./images/1-153.png">153</a>]</span>
the Rais never spoke much against the French. He
often said, "I wish the French would exterminate the
<i>Sh&acirc;nbah</i> banditti, the Sultan would applaud them for it.
I pray God the French will destroy these robbers."</p>

<p>Continue to agitate the question of a tour farther into
the interior. Have almost determined to pursue the
route of Ghat, and accompany the ghafalah of the Ghadamsee
merchants. This route has two advantages for
me&mdash;I shall be safe with my old friends the merchants,
and the route has never before been trodden by an
European traveller. The routes of Bornou and Timbuctoo
have been travelled by Europeans, though some of
the parties have never returned. One thing is certain&mdash;unless
I go to the first-hand traffickers in human flesh&mdash;to
the heart of Africa itself, I can never get the information
which I require. Am told I can defray the expense
of the whole journey from here to Kanou and back,
(exclusive of presents), for about fifty pounds sterling,
but it must be with economy. Afterwards saw several
merchants again on the question, felt discouraged, and
my faith shook in the Ghat route. They think the best
route for me Bornou, thence I may proceed to Kanou,
and perhaps even to Timbuctoo. It is astonishing how
everybody's opinion varies; the majority, nevertheless,
are in favour of the Bornou route for me. Probably
they are afraid of the responsibility of escorting me
through the Touarick districts. Determined a day or
two after to go to Kanou <i>vi&acirc;</i> Ghat and Aheer. Cannot
see any danger if I stick close to the Ghadamsee merchants.
A young merchant said to me, "Y&acirc;cob, we
are not jealous of you, for you are not a merchant.
You can draw your money, and get it ready. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-154" id="V1-154"></a>[<a href="./images/1-154.png">154</a>]</span>
ghafalah will be cheap for you, for no escort will be
required. You can go without your Consul, or the
Pasha, or the Rais."</p>

<p>The wind continues hot to-day; the <i>ghiblee</i> is getting
more suffocating and intense. Everything is drooping
and the poor emaciated fasters are dying with thirst.
The air is as the small still breath of the furnace
when its heat is at the greatest intensity, without flame
or smoke.</p>

<p><i>11th.</i>&mdash;Every day, in spite of the Ramadan, brings an
increase of patients. In time there will not be a single
inhabitant of Ghadames who has not been physicked by
my quackery. I notice my negro servant Said is gradually
expanding into a full-blown reputation, of which he
is very proud. The Mussulmans pay him almost more
deference than myself, and I ought to be jealous. It is
the plan in these countries to influence the masters
through the servants; so whenever anything is to be
obtained, the masters are not spoken to, but the servants,
which latter are feed and bribed until the object is
obtained. Preached anti-slavery and anti-Ramadan doctrines
to Berka, the liberated slave of Sheikh Makouran.
The poor fellow confessed it was better to eat and drink
in the Ramadan, and not steal men and sell them as
slaves, than to fast in the Ramadan, and steal men and
sell them. The old lad has great influence amongst the
slaves of Ghadames, being their senior, and the liberated
slave of one of the most respectable men of the country.
He went and preached in turn to the slaves my anti-slavery
and anti-fast principles.</p>

<p>It may be observed here, that information can only be
obtained bit by bit, here a little and there a little; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-155" id="V1-155"></a>[<a href="./images/1-155.png">155</a>]</span>
it is absolutely necessary to note everything down immediately
if you would not forget it, at least if you would
be correct. The Moors and Arabs have no patience,
beyond a few minutes, in giving information, unless it be
something where their own interests are deeply concerned.
My scattered notes must then be compared one with
another to arrive at a proper idea of the objects respecting
which they treat. Some notes will necessarily
correct others.</p>

<p>A Touarick came in whilst I was eating my dinner
this evening, about half an hour before sun-set. I was
sitting in the patio, or open court of my house. The
Touarick, standing erect before me, with a long spear in
his right hand, and extending his left towards the sky,
looked up, and then, with an air of imposing solemnity,
uttered these words in a measured, solemn tone:
"And&mdash;thou&mdash;Christian&mdash;thou fastest&mdash;thus! Thy father&mdash;knoweth&mdash;not&mdash;God!
Thou art a <i>Kafer</i>&mdash;he is a Kafer&mdash;and
the fire<a name="FNa_1-25" id="FNa_1-25"></a><a href="#FoN_1-25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> at last will eat you both up!" Turning
round, and looking up to this prophet-like denunciator, I
said, smiling: "Why, how now? you Mussulmans fast,
and think you are righteous; but whether is it better
to eat and drink on the Ramadan, for which God
cares nothing, or fast in the Ramadan, and go afterwards
and steal or buy men and women and little children,
like your little son there, and take them to Tripoli,
and sell them like donkeys and camels? This is forbidden
to us English&mdash;this is our religion, not to steal and sell
men, but to eat and drink in the Ramadan is not forbidden
to us." After this answer, which I had some difficulty
in making him comprehend, the fellow stood<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-156" id="V1-156"></a>[<a href="./images/1-156.png">156</a>]</span>
speechless, completely staggered. I continued to eat my
dinner with a good appetite, notwithstanding his threatening
position and silence. God knows what was passing
through his mind. After a long pause he receded back
a few steps, and then quietly squatted down. He then
got up again, and said, "Have you any medicines for my
mother in Ghat?" I told him to come to-morrow, and
I would give him some.</p>

<p>Rais occupied as usual this morning with collecting
money. He avows with exasperation that the people
have deposited all their money in the hands of a few
merchants of Tripoli, who are under the protection of
the Consuls. He was writing teskeras to obtain money
from those Tripoli merchants. "The Pasha," he added,
"gets no benefit from these deposits, nor the people.
The Tripoli merchants are lying, bloodsucking Jews."
Did not go out again till the evening; occupied in copying
a long letter for <i>The Times</i>. My sugar and tea go
very fast. Do not know what I should have done unless
the Ramadan had interposed to save these luxuries of
The Desert. It is surprising how rigid the fast is kept.
Not a soul in the city of the proper age who does
not fast.</p>

<p><i>12th.</i>&mdash;Weather continues very sultry. The wind has
scarcely changed for a month, always south. To-day I
ate camel's flesh for the first time, but did not like it
much; it depends, however, upon the part you eat, as
also upon the camel itself, whether young or old, or in a
good condition. The camel is usually killed when past
work, and very lean and poor. The people call camels'
flesh their beef; it does serve as a substitute for bullocks'
flesh, no bullocks being killed here. The whole<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-157" id="V1-157"></a>[<a href="./images/1-157.png">157</a>]</span>
carcase was immediately sold as soon as exposed in the
Souk.</p>

<p><i>13th.</i>&mdash;Wrote this evening to the Governor of Ghat,
to tell him I wished to come to Ghat, and begged for his
protection; and that I should be obliged if he could
send some trusty person to fetch me, whose expenses I
would pay. Wrote also letters to go by courier to
Tripoli.</p>

<p><i>14th.</i>&mdash;Weather continues hot. My taleb calls the
season <i>khareef</i>, "autumn;" and says the fruits of heaven
which are always ripe have nevertheless a peculiar ripeness
at this period. Staring at him, he continued, "Yes,
there is a greater correspondence between earth and
heaven than people think." I was recommended this
taleb by the Rais. He writes my Arabic letters for The
Desert; he calls himself Mohammed Ben Mousa Bel
Kasem. The reader will hear now a great deal about
him, and his learning and character. He takes up my
Arabic Bible now and then, and reads a verse or two;
but it is astonishing how little effect, even in the way of
curiosity, it produces on the mind of these Mussulmans.
One would think at least they would like to know something
of its contents. Notwithstanding, The Book, which
contains the religion of the civilized world, hardly excites
curiosity enough in them to take it up and read a single
verse! I have often offered it to them to read, but they
have refused to open the book. A great disadvantage is
the crabbed, miserable language into which it is translated.
After the bold, impudent, and sublime language
of the Koran, they cannot relish the tame and stunted
language of the Arabic New Testament. As for the
simple and grand truths of the New Testament, these<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-158" id="V1-158"></a>[<a href="./images/1-158.png">158</a>]</span>
they cannot or will not comprehend. Force, or the
Sword&mdash;as the Might of the Almighty&mdash;is the thing
alone which strikes the minds of Mussulmans, in spite of
all their moral maxims and philosophy. But I must confess
I never expected that a religion like that of the Koran,
which contains so few fundamental truths, and so few mysteries,
would have produced such a race of superstitious
pharisees. To-day a fellow, whose eyes are dreadfully
inflamed with ophthalmia, refuses to have them <i>doctored</i>,
because the solution administered to the eye may enter
the stomach, by which he would violate the sanctity of
the Ramadan. I can only beg him to come at night.
Another jackanapes, who suffers equally, refuses to have
my solution at all applied. He said to me, "I suffer,
and I may be blind, but it will be the will of God." I
wonder the whole population is not blind. Another
sufferer craved a talisman to drink with water at
night<a name="FNa_1-26" id="FNa_1-26"></a><a href="#FoN_1-26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>.</p>

"On the 8th, I found myself very ill in consequence of the
food, and I had an attack of fever. I took a few doses of sulphate
of quinine, which had the effect of abating the fever for a few days.
My host seemed much concerned at my indisposition. He searched
through some old books which contained verses of the Koran, and
brought me a scrap of paper well fumigated on which was written
a charm in Arabic characters, assuring me that it was an excellent
remedy for the disorder under which I was suffering. He directed
me to copy it on a little piece of wood which he brought me; then,
to wash off the writing with some water which I was to drink: he
observed that this would to a certainty relieve me. To please him
I copied the writing as he directed, and when he was gone washed
the bit of board; but instead of drinking the water I threw it
away, which had quite as good an effect, for next day I found
myself tolerably well. My host, of course, attributed my amendment
to the efficacy of his remedy."</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A taleb</span> tells me that <i>The Sahara</i> is so called from
its consisting mostly of rocky stony ground, and its
name is a cognate term with <i>Sakharah</i>, &#8238;&#1589;&#1582;&#1585;&#1577;&#8236;, <i>i. e.</i> "rock."
This derivation we can scarcely admit, although as we
advance into The Sahara we shall find at least a third of
its entire surface to consist of rocks and stones, and
mountains. <i>The Sahara</i>&mdash;&#8238;&#1575;&#1604;&#1589;&#1581;&#1585;&#1575;&#8236;&mdash;being the theatre of
my adventures and researches, deserves a little <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'considertion'">consideration</ins>
as to the derivation of this appellation, for so vast
a proportion of the African Continent. A late French
writer, M. Le Lieutenant-Colonel Daumas, defines
The Sahara as "une contr&eacute;e plate et tr&egrave;s-vaste, o&ugrave; il n'y
a que peu d'habitants, et dont la plus grande partie est
improductive et sablonneuse." This definition presents no<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-160" id="V1-160"></a>[<a href="./images/1-160.png">160</a>]</span>
proper idea of The Sahara. We have already seen it
intersected with long low ridges of mountains, but we
shall soon meet with groups of high mountains, as well
as find it bristled over and bounded by interminable
chains. We shall find also that but a certain portion of
its actual mass consists of sand. Unproductive the
greater part undoubtedly is, or rather uncultivated; and
its population, compared with its vast sterile surface, is
extremely small, perhaps not one inhabitant to many
thousand square miles. The Mahometan talebs give the
following curious etymology of the term Sahara. "We
call <i>Sehaur</i>," they say, "that point scarcely distinguishable
which precedes the point of day, (<i>fidger</i>), and
during which, in the time of Ramadan, we can eat, drink,
and smoke. The most rigorous abstinence ought to commence
from the time of morning, or when we can distinguish
a white thread from a black thread. The
<i>Sehaur</i> is then a shade between night and the point of
day, which is important for us to seize upon and to determine,
and which ought to occupy the attention of our
Marabouts. One of them, Ben-ej-Jiramy, starting on
the principle, that the <i>Sehaur</i> is more easily and sooner
distinguished by the inhabitants of the plains, where nothing
bounds the horizon, than by the mountaineers, who
are enveloped in masses of earth, concludes that, from the
name of the phenomenon there formed, viz., on the plains,
where it is more particularly distinguished or observed, we
have named the country <i>Sahara</i>, or the country of the
<i>Sehaur</i>." In this whimsical and ingenious derivation
there is a change of the &#8238;&#1587;&#8236; into &#8238;&#1589;&#8236;, but which is sufficiently
frequent in the Shemitic languages. The grand
fallacy of the above etymology is, that it assumes the<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-161" id="V1-161"></a>[<a href="./images/1-161.png">161</a>]</span>
Sahara to be a perfectly flat country, or country of
plains, which is not the fact. The talebs also
give various names to different portions of The Sahara,
according to the geological character of the country.
<i>Feeafee</i> is The Oasis, where life is retired, and one
spends one's happy days amidst eternal springs of living
water, reclining under palms and fruit trees, securely
sheltered from the burning simoon (<i>shoub</i>). <i>Keefar</i>, is
the sandy arid plain, which, occasionally watered by the
winter's revivifying refreshing and fructifying rains, produces
spring herbage, where the Nomade tribes pasture
their flocks in the neighbourhood of the oases. <i>Falat</i>, is
the region of sands in the immensity of steril wastes.
But all these distinctions are arbitrary, and can be predicated
of tracts of country lying on the North Coast of
Africa, as well as the boundless Sahara. On the coast of
Tripoli we have the oasis, the arid plain, and the groups
of sand-hills of eternal sterility. Captain Lyon enumerates
in the same way as the talebs, the various names
which the Arabs apply to different regions of The
Desert. <i>Sahara</i> is sand alone, forming a plane surface,
which agrees with the hypothesis of Ben-ej-Jiramy.
<i>Ghoud</i> is groups of sand-hills of indefinite height, situate
on the borders of stony plains, where the wind has
formed and collected them. <i>Sereer</i>, is generally plains,
whence the sand-hills have been swept, and where alone
sand-hills are found. <i>W&acirc;r</i>, is a rough plain, covered
with large detached stones, lying in confusion, and very
<i>difficult</i> to pass over, which is the meaning of the appellation.
It is applied to all difficult traverse. <i>Hateea</i>,
is a spot possessing the power of fertility; indeed, those
patches of land which are the germs of the oases, now<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-162" id="V1-162"></a>[<a href="./images/1-162.png">162</a>]</span>
producing small stinted shrubs scattered at intervals,
from which camels browse a scanty meal, or travellers
make their Desert fire. <i>Wishek</i>, is productive sand-hills
and plains, where the wild palm and lethel-tree grow.
<i>Ghabah</i>, distinguishes cultivated Sahara, sometimes a
portion of the oases, but mostly where there are no inhabitants.
So near Touat, there is a cultivated place called
Ghabah, and without inhabitants. But the people of
Ghadames call also their gardens Ghabah. Sibhah, is
the usual name for all salt plains, sometimes called <i>Shot</i>
in Algeria, being mostly sandy salt marshes. Like the
Sibhah of Emjessen, and "The Lake of Marks," in Tunis,
the saline particles are often combined with earths or
sand so closely as to form a substance resembling stone,
and equally hard to break or cut through. With this
<i>salt</i> stone houses are built. <i>Wady</i>, is the designation of
all long deep depressions of the surface, and is used indifferently
for a valley, a bed of a river, or torrent, or ravine.
These wadys are almost always dry, except one or two
months in the winter. <i>Gibel</i>, is applied to all hills and
mountains. It is quite evident, from the above enumeration,
that these various terms can be equally applied to
the coast and other regions of land, not comprehended
within the assigned limits of The Sahara, and are therefore
not peculiar to The Great Desert of Sahara.</p>

<p>All the people are astonished when I tell them the
British Sovereign is a lady. They have enough to believe
it; indeed, some of them do not, and think I am trifling
with their credulity. It goes against the grain, and their
grain especially, to be ruled over by a woman, (though
many of them, from my own personal knowledge, are
entirely under the influence of their wives <i>in private</i>, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-163" id="V1-163"></a>[<a href="./images/1-163.png">163</a>]</span>
all or most men are,) and is contrary to all their notions
of government and womankind. I was surrounded with
a group when the information was given, and I shall just
mention the questions which were put to me in rapid
succession. "Does that woman <i>govern well</i>?" "Has
she a husband? What does her husband?" "Has she
any children?" "Is she a big woman?" "Is she beautiful?"
"How much does she pay you for coming to our
country?" "Who has more power, she or the Sultan (of
Constantinople)?" "What's her name?" "Have the
Christians any other women who govern?" And so
forth. I explained to them that Spain and Portugal
were ruled by two other Queens, but that, in France, a
Queen never reigns. At the mention of this latter fact,
there was general murmur of approbation, "El-Francees
&acirc;ndhom <i>&acirc;kel</i> (the French have wisdom)." To soften the
matter down a little, and abate their prejudices, I told
them the father of the Queen of England had no sons,
and in all such cases, if there were daughters, these were
allowed to govern the people. "Batel (stupid)," said
one fellow, and the conversation dropped.</p>

<p>Begin to like the place, as I find I can pick up information
respecting the interior. The merchants seem now
more disposed to assume the responsibility of taking me
with them. Went through the market-place, and witnessed
a sitting of judgment upon a sick camel. This
was an affair of the Kady, a little, fat, chubby, cherub-looking
fellow, but proud and silent. The people said
he was <i>sagheer</i>, "young," and excused his uncanonical
conduct. He sat, high placed on a stone-bench, amidst
a semicircle of people, squatting on the ground. He
looked very grave, now exchanging a word or half syl<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-164" id="V1-164"></a>[<a href="./images/1-164.png">164</a>]</span>lable
with one, now with another, but continually moving
his lips as if in prayer. I met him afterwards in the
street, and always found him moving the lips, with his
rosary of black Mecca beads in his hands. He holds a
separate and independent jurisdiction from the Rais, and
is the Archbishop or Pope of Ghadames. His decision
cannot be annulled by the authorities in Tripoli, but
must be referred to the Ulemas at Constantinople. He
therefore thinks not a little of himself, and with reason.
Four questions were now before the Kady, embracing
physic, law, and divinity.</p>

<p>1st. To whom did the camel belong (for the Arabs
disputed this)?</p>

<p>2nd. Could it recover from its sickness, or was it
incurable?</p>

<p>3rd. Whether it should be killed, if it could not be
cured?</p>

<p>4th. Whether it should be eaten after it was killed?</p>

<p>The diseased, emaciated camel lay groaning just without
the semicircle. There was a large abscess over the
shoulders, produced by the loads it had carried, besides
other sores. A million of flies was then settled on the
abscess, which was a running sore. It was a most disgusting
sight. But not to the people who eyed the poor
animal as connoisseurs. I learnt afterwards the Kady's
decision was: "The camel is incurable, but may be killed
and eaten." I asked the people whether they were not
afraid to eat an animal which was so much diseased.
They replied, "No, it is the judgment of the Kady.
To-morrow we shall kill and eat it. To-day there's
camels' flesh enough." I was astonished at the Kady's
decision, and told the people diseased animals were not<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-165" id="V1-165"></a>[<a href="./images/1-165.png">165</a>]</span>
allowed to be killed for eating in our country, for there
was danger in their making people ill. Some approved of
this; but the population is much poorer than I, at first,
thought, and the indigent are glad to catch anything.
The few rich bury their money in foreign speculations, or
hoard it up in their houses. After the decision, the
miserable camel was left alone in the Souk, a prey to the
flies, which were voraciously feeding on its running sores,
till the next day. Semi-civilized people cannot comprehend
the mercy or duty of alleviating the sufferings of
the inferior creation.</p>

<p>To-day a new case of severe ophthalmia. This was
that of a woman, who also had a fever. To my agreeable
surprise, a number of her friends decided that she should
take a fever-powder, in spite of the Ramadan. I administered
it myself, and she drank it greedily. I was
glad of such a marked exception to the rigid fasting.
Her relatives said she was permitted to drink it, first,
because she was <i>a woman</i>, and, secondly, because she
was sick. This was the law of the Kady. Met a remarkable
Touarick in the streets. This is an old worn-out
man, with one eye, and that much damaged. In his
day he has been a famous bandit, has plundered many a
caravan and murdered the hapless merchants. He is
now, in his dreadful old age, sheltered in the very city
whose wayfaring merchants he so often plundered and
murdered. The judgment of heaven seems pressing hard
upon him; for he is poor and miserable, a beggar in the
streets&mdash;all his ill-gotten wealth is gone! He leads
about a little lad, whom he calls his son, and who seems
to afford the wretched old villain his only repose of<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-166" id="V1-166"></a>[<a href="./images/1-166.png">166</a>]</span>
mind, if repose he can have from so horrible a conscience.
I gave the child a small coin. The inhabitants
feed the bandit, and tolerate him with an admirable
spirit of merciful forgiveness. And if <i>they</i> do,
who cries for vengeance?</p>

<p>Wrote to-day a letter to the Pasha of Tripoli, thanking
His Highness for the kind attentions I had received
from the Governor of Ghadames. I never did anything
with such good will. It was, besides, an absolute
duty.</p>

<p>This afternoon examined phrenologically, <i>bump</i>ologically,
the heads of many children. There was a considerable
variety in the <i>bumps</i>, as well as the configuration, of the
cranium. Some of the heads were well flattened on
either side, others rounded, and mostly low, depressed
foreheads, with "self-esteem" and "love of approbation"
ascending appallingly far up at the back of the head.
Very few men or children have the frontal regions well
developed. Examined a man esteemed a great dervish,
who is always reading and writing the Koran. It's
strange that the saint had the organ of veneration well
developed. The Rais hearing of my cunning in this
occult science, which some of the people called a new
<i>deen</i>, ("religion,") wished to see me perform; so, on
visiting him in the evening, he ordered forth all his
understrappers and hangers-on, and made them submit
to the fearful ordeal of head <i>pummelling</i>, first begging me
to speak out everything, and then calling for fire to
light his pipe, that he might muse over the exhibition
<i>&agrave; la Turque</i>. The first officer examined was collector of
the revenue, a native of Derge, a regular task-master in<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-167" id="V1-167"></a>[<a href="./images/1-167.png">167</a>]</span>
his way, and very malicious; I was frightened what to
say. All was attention, the Rais particularly wishing to
know if he was a thief, and had secreted Government
money in his house. This his Excellency told me afterwards,
when we were alone. The collector happened, by
good luck, to have a large "acquisitiveness," and "benevolence"
at the same time. This I explained to the
Rais, and said the one balanced or neutralized the other.
Tayeb, ("good"), said his Excellency, much chagrined,
his Excellency evidently wishing to have had the fellow
made out a thief. I must not continue through all the
examinations. Suffice it to say, by this display of my
new craft, I was raised very much in the estimation of
everybody. But the most surprising thing was, a Touarick
affirmed to the Rais, with great vehemence, that
one of his neighbours was a phrenologist, and acquired
his knowledge from the <i>jenoun</i> ("demons"). The major-domo
of his Excellency, (who had had a good character
given to him in the examination,) was very angry at
this attempt to lower my credit of being the first to teach
phrenology in the The Desert, and pushed the Touarick
out of the Rais's house, and we only just escaped a disturbance,
or losing all our fun, the Touarick drawing his
sword to defend himself. In general I was disappointed,
and did not observe the African and Moorish forms of
cranium so much marked as I expected. They were all,
thank goodness, pretty cleanly shaved. It is well known
Mussulmans generally shave their heads, and leave their
beards unshaven. This is, then, a splendid field for
accurate phrenological observation. I observed that the
negroes have all of them "self-esteem" most surprisingly
developed. From this, (if the science were true, which I<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-168" id="V1-168"></a>[<a href="./images/1-168.png">168</a>]</span>
very much question<a name="FNa_1-27" id="FNa_1-27"></a><a href="#FoN_1-27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>,) we could easily deduce their habitual
gaiety, for a man who has always a good opinion of
himself is rarely miserable.</p>

<p>Just after the examination finished, whilst we were all
very gay, smoking, drinking coffee, talking, and laughing,
one of the Moors started up suddenly, and in an instant,
taking his shoe, lying beside him, struck something
down with a great smack on the floor; it turned out to
be an immense scorpion! I felt a chill start through all
my blood. The smashed reptile looked hideous in the dim
light of the Ramadan lamp. This is the third scorpion
within a fortnight the Rais has killed in his own house;
one of enormous size he killed a few days ago. The Rais
called for more coffee, and said coolly and laconically,
"It's all <i>maktoub</i> between you and the scorpions; if they
are to bite you, they will." His Excellency thought the
sting often deadly. My taleb joins the rest in their
notions of fatality. In coming home with me afterwards,
I said to him, "I am alarmed at these scorpions, as
there's no security from them; for you say they get
upon the beds, on the tops of the houses, and in every
hole and corner." The taleb&mdash;"I am not afraid; I am
always killing them in my house, and yet I fear them
not, for it's all from God. If they are destined by <i>Rubbee</i>
to sting me to death, they will, so I do not disturb myself.
You Christians are foolish." It does not appear
that this reptile strikes a person unless it be attacked, or
trodden upon. The people say they feed on <i>tr&#257;b</i>,
"dust" or "dirt." Yesterday the chameleon was seen in<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-169" id="V1-169"></a>[<a href="./images/1-169.png">169</a>]</span>
the gardens: there is a few in Ghadames, and in most
parts of North Africa. The one I saw was a most
unsightly creature. The construction of the eyes is
remarkable; they turn on a swivel, or seem to do so, and
are directed every way in a moment of time. It is a
trite observation, that the lower brute animal has many
advantages over the more perfect and rational animal. I
often, <i>en route</i>, admired the beautiful facility with which
the camel turned its head and neck completely round,
and looked upon objects in every direction, without even
moving its body, or if in motion, without stopping. I
watched the chameleon a long time, to see it "change its
colour;" it did so continually, but scarcely any of the
colours were agreeable or beautiful; they were mostly
dunnish red and yellow, and sometimes black brown;
often-times it was covered with spots, now with stripes,
now with neither one nor the other. Once it was an
ugly black, and then of a light pale-green yellow. The
fewness of animals in this oasis occasions me to record
its appearance. The people mention two or three
varieties of the species. They are fond of the chameleons,
at least, give them the full liberty of the gardens,
without attempting to destroy them.</p>

<p>The Seb&acirc;ah, a freebooting tribe of Tunisian Arabs on
the frontier, who some two months ago plundered a
Ghadames caravan near Gharian, have been made to render
up an account of the spoil. The Pasha of Tripoli
wrote to the Bey of Tunis, and the Bey has undertaken
to make them surrender their booty. The value is only
about 1000 dollars, and forty camels. People are very
inquisitive about my personal affairs. They ask me
repeatedly, why I don't marry, or where are my wife and<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-170" id="V1-170"></a>[<a href="./images/1-170.png">170</a>]</span>
children? and add, "for you are getting old, and have
plenty of money." I usually reply, "I can't carry a
wife about with me all over the world." In the Desert
and all over North Africa, it is looked upon as a species
of disgrace for a man not to be married. It perhaps
ought to be so everywhere; but our social system of
Europe is become now so bad, that nearly half of the
people cannot afford to marry. And so degraded in
their feelings have become the lower classes of the
British Isles, that many of those who do marry, marry
with the clear understood determination of throwing
their offspring upon the public bounty. The Puseyite
and Church alms-giving clergy, to their shame, encourage
our miserable population in these most despicable sentiments,
and tell the people it is their right as granted to
them by the founder and apostles of the Christian
Church. Tyrants must have slaves, and priestly tyrants
as well as other sorts of tyrants; it is therefore necessary
there should be propagated a race of slaves.</p>

<p>This morning the poor old blind man demands the
strong medicine for his eye. He says, "I feel less pain
in my eyes though I see no better." O Dio! what a
precious gift is sight&mdash;how persevering is this old man to
see again those sights of desert, palm, and oasis, which
he saw in his youthful days! Perhaps there is a tenth
of the population of Ghadames nearly blind, or quite
blind. The Sheikh Makouran has calculated the expense
from Ghadames to Kanou, and back, for me, at two
hundred dollars. The Moors are essentially children in
some things. Young men, full grown, carry about with
them in their pockets a little bit of white sugar to suck,
stowed away in needlecases. To-day, a ghafalah of<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-171" id="V1-171"></a>[<a href="./images/1-171.png">171</a>]</span>
Touaricks, twenty persons, left for Ghat. They took my
letter for the Governor. The Touaricks are getting used
to the sight of a Christian. My opinion is also undergoing
a favourable change towards them. Certainly, the
best informed of the Ghadamsee people give them a good
character.</p>

<p><i>15th.</i>&mdash;The Rais killed two more scorpions after I left
him last night. A child was bitten a few days ago by a
scorpion, and died to-day. His Excellency hopes they
will disappear <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'aftet'">after</ins> the Ramadan. The scorpion, like
many other venemous and deadly animals, is a creature
of <i>heat</i>, and in the winter is never seen. The scorpion
usually comes out of his hiding-places, or the crevices of
the walls, during night time, and is rarely seen in the
day. Various remedies for its bite or sting, or stroke, are
in vogue here. People usually employ garlic: they both
eat it and rub it into the bitten or stricken part. Others
cut round the stung part, and then rub over the whole
with snuff. People persist that the scorpion eats dust,
but that he is very fond of <i>striking Ben-Adam</i> ("the
human race.") Two nights after the scorpion affair with
the Rais, to our dread and horror, Said killed a large
one close by our beds. We always sleep upon the
ground-floor on matting. He was <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'dosing'">dozing</ins> in the night,
after his Ramadan midnight meal, when the monster
scrambled past by his head like an enormous crab. In
the morning he showed me his sting as a trophy of
victory. We then examined all the walls in our sleeping
apartment, and stopped up cracks and crevices. After a
short time the scorpions were forgotten, or we got used
to them; and the next one that Said had a chase after,
excited in me little attention. So I found, like the<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-172" id="V1-172"></a>[<a href="./images/1-172.png">172</a>]</span>
Moors, myself a fatalist, or at least became reconciled to
the presence of these death-stinging reptiles. I found
eventually, in fact, the people killed them with as much
unconcern as we do spiders. The scorpion is the only
creature armed with the fatal power of destroying life,
which, for the present I hear of in the oases of The
Sahara. The Arabs, in their hatred of the Touaricks,
say, "The scorpion and the Touarick are the only enemies
you meet with in The Sahara."</p>

<p><i>16th.</i>&mdash;The old worn-out bandit met me, and asked
me to cure his rheumatic pains. "Show me your
tongue," I said. He flatly refused, as several persons
were present. Then when I went away he came running
after me, and tried to put out his tongue, but did
not succeed. I told him to drink plenty of hot broth,
and go to bed. He seemed satisfied. An Arab soldier
afflicted with diarrh&#339;a, came for medicine. He waited
till the last rays of the sun were seen to depart from the
minaret's top, before he would take his pills. Meanwhile,
he gave me a catalogue of grievances, the sum and
substance of which was, "he had nothing to eat." I
questioned him over and over again, and then, coming to
the same stern conclusion, I gave him some supper.
Some weeks ago the Rais gave each soldier 3 Tunisian
piastres, about 1<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i> Since then they had had nothing.
Substantially, I believe, he spoke the truth, for
these poor fellows are kept just above the starvation-to-death
point. It is not surprising they wish to return to
their homes, or Tripoli, and that they pilfer about the
town. Asking him why the Rais did not give them a
few karoobs, he replied naively, "The Rais has none for
us, but plenty to buy gold for his horse's saddle." To-<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-173" id="V1-173"></a>[<a href="./images/1-173.png">173</a>]</span>day,
nor yesterday, could I buy any eatable meat. I
mean mutton, for this is the ordinary meat of the place,
and upon which I live, with now and then a fowl. But
in the Souk another camel was killed, and a great display
was made of its meat. The camel was ill before
killed, but not so bad as the one already mentioned.
Some fifty persons were enjoying the sight of the camel
being cut up, for the Moorish butchers always cut up
their meat into very small portions, sometimes not bigger
than a couple of mouthsful. Before killed, the camel
sold for one hundred and eight Tunisian piastres; the
one on which the Kady gave judgment, only produced
thirty-three. (Tunisian piastres vary from 7<i>d.</i> to 9<i>d.</i>)</p>

<p>Yesterday the weather sultry, and a few drops of rain
fell on the parched oasis&mdash;drops of ambrosia from the
gods. To-day it is cloudy and cool, for the first time
since my residence here; a cool elastic sensation braces
up my poor drooping frame.</p>

<p>The Moor picks up every bit, or little dirty scrap of
paper he finds in the streets, and places it in a hole of the
wall, or upon a ledge, lest there should be written on it,
"the name of God," and the sacred name be trodden
upon and profaned. It is probable they derived the
superstition from the Jews, who have many mysterious
notions about certain letters which form the name of
The Almighty. I have often seen &#8238;&#1513;&#1491;&#1497;&#8236; affixed on the
door-posts of Jewish houses in Barbary. But no people
in the world use the name of God more vainly than
Mussulmans, nor swear more than they, the greater
part of the words used being different epithets of the
Divine Nature. This inconsistency runs through all the
actions of these semi-civilized people. No people pre<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-174" id="V1-174"></a>[<a href="./images/1-174.png">174</a>]</span>tend
to more delicacy in the mode of dress, more respect
for women, not even mentioning the names or existence
of their wives. My late Marabout camel-driver, when
speaking of his wife and family, merely said <i>saghar</i>
("little children"). And, notwithstanding all this, no
people are more sensual and impure, and esteem women
less, than the Moors of towns. In swearing and oaths,
the epithets "With God!" "By God!" "God!" "The
Lord!" or "My Lord (<i>Rubbee</i>)!" "God, the Most High!"
and, "The Most Sacred Majesty of God (<i>Subkhanah
Allah</i>)!" are the common forms of using the Divine
Name. A Tibboo stranger went into a house to buy a
pair of pistols, and the seller was not at home. My
taleb, who was a neighbour, and was anxious his friend
should sell his pistols, run about exclaiming, <i>Subkhanah
Allah!</i> I confess I was greatly shocked on hearing
these most awful words used in such a way. I taxed
the taleb afterwards with it, and compared his conduct
with what I had seen in his picking up bits of paper in my
house, for fear the names of The Deity should be upon
them. He merely answered pettishly, "What do you
wish? all people say so." A less serious note may be
added here, that of the loose and curious way in which
the Arabs express their ideas of quantities and distances.
"Great" and "small" means with them any quantities,
as "near" and "afar," any distances. I asked an
Arab of Tunis when he expected his caravan? He
replied, <i>Ghareeb</i> ("near"). "What do you mean, a
week, a fortnight, or how long?" "<i>Twenty days!</i>" was
the reply. In endeavouring to obtain information from
these people on distances and quantities, the only way
is to make them compare the thing unknown with what<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-175" id="V1-175"></a>[<a href="./images/1-175.png">175</a>]</span>
you know. They will tell you at such a place is an
exceedingly high mountain. If there is a hill or a mountain
near you at the time, you must ask them if it as large
or larger than that? In this way you will frequently
find their great mountain to be no bigger than a hillock.</p>

<p>The merchants say it is necessary to give presents to
the following princes of authority, in the route of
Soudan:&mdash;</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Touaricks.</span></h4>

<ul><li>Governor of the town of Ghat;</li>
<li>The Sultan of the Touaricks of Ghat, and the surrounding districts;</li>
<li>The Sultan of Aheer; and</li>
<li>The Sultan of Aghadez:</li>
</ul>

<p>and these princes demand presents as a matter of right.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Fullannee and Negroes.</span></h4>

<ul><li>The Governor of Damerghou;</li>
<li>The Sultan of Tesouwah;</li>
<li>The Deputy-Sultan of Kashna; and</li>
<li>The Deputy-Sultan of Kanou:</li>
</ul>

<p>but these latter princes do not demand presents as a
matter of right, leaving it to the good pleasure of the
stranger. There are also a few other smaller places where
a trifling present will help a merchant on his way. The
presents are collected according to the means and wealth
of each individual merchant, each subscribing his share,
one giving a burnouse, others a piece of cloth, or silk, or
beads, and what not. The whole is then collected together,
and a deputation of two or three merchants is
formed out of the caravan, who convey their presents to
the prince, and the prince, when he finds the merchants<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-176" id="V1-176"></a>[<a href="./images/1-176.png">176</a>]</span>
have treated him liberally, sometimes returns a present
of a slave or two, but generally a quantity of fresh provisions.</p>

<p>A small ghafalah of Touaricks having left to-day for
Touat, Sheik Makouran, whose merchandise they were
escorting on its way to Timbuctoo, begged me to write
a letter to the Sheikh of Ain-Salah, one of the oases,
which is in direct commercial relations with Ghadames.
The plain English of the letter was, that Sheikh Haj
Mohammed Welled Abajoudah, of Ain-Salah, would
receive me friendly if I came to him, would protect all
Englishmen travelling through his country, and would
not let them be attacked and murdered as Major Laing
was. When I gave my friend Makouran the letter, he
asked me what I had written. I related the substance.
"Allah, Allah!" exclaimed old Makouran; "Why, the
Sheikh of Ain-Salah is my friend, he'll treat you as
kindly as I do; he's one of us." Then he added,
"Never mind, the letter may go." This evening the
Rais was very unwell. Gave his Excellency some purgative
pills. Afraid he will be obliged to return to Tripoli
for his health; poor fellow, he suffers greatly.</p>

<p><i>17th.</i>&mdash;The weather has opened this morning, dull,
cloudy, and cool, threatening rain. A dingy veil is
drawn over the face of things.</p>

<p>Have not yet seen any pretty plays amongst the children.
All is dullest monotony. The youth, however,
ultimately recover their wits by travelling. My turjeman
says, "The natives of Ghadames are the greatest travellers
in the world, and are to be found in every country."
The <i>Souk</i> offers nothing for sale but olive-oil, liquid
butter, a little bread, camels' flesh, and now and then a<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-177" id="V1-177"></a>[<a href="./images/1-177.png">177</a>]</span>
few vegetables. All the Touarick traders have now left,
some for Ghat and others for Touat. My Ghadamsee
friends cease talking of the dangers of my Soudan trip,
and it is a settled thing that I go. Some of them wish
me to try a fasting day; "one day, to see how I like it,"
they tell me.</p>

<p>It is very amusing to see butchers in this place cut up
their meat. Four, eight, or twelve persons, join to buy
a sheep. The sheep is killed, and the butcher has to
divide it into as many equal parts as joint-purchasers.
He begins by dividing it into four equal parts, but
not in the way we should imagine, by cutting the carcase
into four. No, quite different. He first divides
the intestines into four portions, cutting the heart, liver,
and lights into four equal portions, and so of the rest.
Sometimes the heart is made a present to some favoured
individual. Of two sheep cut up to-day, the heart of
one was given to a young friend of mine, and that of the
other to the Governor. The intestines divided, the
butcher proceeds to divide the legs and shoulders into
four equal portions, dividing one leg and one shoulder
into two, and so of the other. The ribs and rest of the
meat is then also equally divided. When the carcase is
thus far divided, a few persons only take one whole
quarter, the rest the butcher proceeds leisurely and
scientifically to divide, several persons taking a whole
quarter divided and subdivided amongst them, not being
able to purchase a large quantity. The quarter is divided
into half-quarters, the half-quarters into quarter-quarters,
and the quarter-quarter is often again divided
and subdivided before it gets into the pot. In this
division, you would imagine the Desert dissector would<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-178" id="V1-178"></a>[<a href="./images/1-178.png">178</a>]</span>
cut the meat all away;&mdash;no such thing; and so great is
the precision with which he divides and subdivides, that
he has no need of scales and weights, equally dividing
every bit of muscle, cartilage, fat, and bone; indeed, every
person goes away perfectly satisfied with the justice of
the division. I never saw scales and weights used on
these occasions. Should, perchance, a difficulty or dispute
arise as to the comparative size of the portions or equal
divisions, a child is then sent for, and each party having
chosen his token&mdash;a piece of wood, a straw, or what not,
the whole are put into the hands of the child, who is
requested to place the sticks or straws upon the portions
of meat it chooses, or to which its caprice may guide.
This decision of the umpire Chance is without or beyond
all appeal. Mussulmans of The Sahara have no idea of
<i>separate joints</i> or choice parts, the heart, perhaps,
excepted, which is highly prized; or, if you will, they
like a bit of every part of the carcase, and cut it up into
these infinitesimal divisions in order that they may obtain
this aggregate of delicate minuti&aelig;. But as this is all
cooked together, there can never be that separate taste
of separate parts which distinguishes the meat as killed
and cooked by Europeans. All Mussulmans are instinctively
butchers, and are familiar with the knife, and
expert at killing animals; it is a sort of religious rite
with them. What I have observed particularly is, there
is none of that shrinking back and chilled-blood shudder
at seeing a poor animal killed, which characterizes Europeans,
and especially the children of Europeans. Here
children may be seen holding the animal whilst its throat
is most barbarously cut! and not flinching a step, or
blinking the eye. Apropos of killing and eating meat,<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-179" id="V1-179"></a>[<a href="./images/1-179.png">179</a>]</span>
I had a long polemical discussion with my taleb upon
the respective rites and ceremonies of Christians and
Mussulmans. I told him what distinguished the religion
of the New Testament was, that it prescribed no rules
for eating and drinking, or dress; that the whole Christian
religion was based upon two great commandments:
"Thou shalt love God with all thy heart, and thy neighbour
as thyself." This, however, only drew from him
the observation, "Before the time of Sidi Mahomet, this
was the religion of the world." I rejoined, "This was
the religion&mdash;still is the religion&mdash;of all the English, who
eat and drink everything that is good, and dress any way
they please; and such is the will of God." The taleb
observed, "You wear braces, which is unlawful." I
could not find out the why and the wherefore, unless it
were that it tightened men-folks up too much for modesty.
I told him the Rais and all Turks had braces to their
pantaloons. He simply replied, "Braces are not permitted
by our marabouts."</p>

<p>North Africa, or this region of The Sahara, more particularly,
is essentially the East, (the Syrian, Arabian
East,) and the religion of Mahomet has indissolubly
bound in ideas, manners, and customs, the inhabitants of
these countries with those of the East. It is, therefore,
very satisfactory to read the <i>Arabic</i> New Testament in
these countries; for, besides presenting all the ideas and
metaphorical adornments, such reading often gives you
the very words and idiomatical expressions of the people.
This correspondence is certainly a strong proof, both that
the latter Biblical writers were natives of the East, and
that the inhabitants of North Africa and The Sahara
were originally emigrants, or colonies from Syria and<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-180" id="V1-180"></a>[<a href="./images/1-180.png">180</a>]</span>
Arabia. This is the opinion of my taleb, and all the
literati of the oasis. My taleb also treated me to-day
with writing the famous Mohammedan prophecy, respecting
the destinies of the East, and the world in general,
and everybody in particular. It runneth according to
this mighty import: "<i>The Dajal</i>, (&#8238;&#1575;&#1604;&#1583;&#1580;&#1575;&#1604;&#8236;,) whose name
is the Messiah, and who is the son of Said, and who is a
monstrous fellow, with one eye, shall come upon the
earth, or rather, go abroad upon the earth, and all the
Jews shall flock around him, and enrol themselves under
his standard, for he is their expected Messiah; and then,
armed with their prowess and gold, he shall slay all
Christians and Mohammedans, and shall reign upon the
earth, after their destruction, forty years. This time
outran, there shall then appear Jesus, the son of Mary,
(the Messiah of the New Testament,) in the clouds, who
shall descend upon the earth with flaming vengeance, and
destroy <i>The Dajal</i>. This done, then shall come the end
of the world." My taleb assures me, upon his <i>parole
d'honneur</i>, that <i>The Dajal</i> will come in forty years from
the present time, or in the year 1885! Khoristan, the
country where he is now bound in chains, is, besides, the
country of Gog and Magog (&#8238;&#1580;&#1608;&#1580; &#1608; &#1605;&#1580;&#1608;&#1580;&#8236;). One of these
gentlemen is very small, indeed a dwarf, about the size
of General Tom Thumb, perhaps one and a half inches
shorter; and the other is tall enough to reach the moon
when it is high over your head. It is strange the Mussulmans
of Ghadames make also the Turks (<i>Truk</i>, as
they call them,) to come from the country of Gog and
Magog. See the following table of the genealogy of all
the people of the earth, especially the Turks, the Touaricks,
and the Russians:<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-181" id="V1-181"></a>[<a href="./images/1-181.png">181</a>]</span>&mdash;</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill1-07.jpg"><img src="./images/ill1-07_th.jpg" alt="Genealogy of all the people of the Earth" title="Genealogy of all the people of the Earth" /></a></p>

<p>Such is the leaf of holy tradition in The Desert. It
is astonishing how all nations love to indulge their gloomy
musings with monsters. The extraction of the Russians
from Gog and Magog is a curiosity; but the Russians,
(<i>Moskou</i>, such is their name here,) are looked upon as a
species of monster, whose jaw is capacious enough to
swallow up all the Turks, and the Sultan of the East.
The Rais has the greatest dread of them, whose native
soil they have already gorged, "These Russians," he
said to me one day, "are always, always, always advancing,
advancing, advancing upon the Sultan." Who will
say the patriotic Turk's apprehensions are groundless?
With regard to the extraction of the Touaricks, I asked
one of these people where his countrymen sprang from. He
answered me, that formerly they were demons, (&#8238;&#1580;&#1606;&#1608;&#1606;&#8236;)
and came from a country near Kanou, on the banks of
The Great River. Another told me, in true Hellenic
style, "The Touaricks sprang out from the ground." An
opinion has been advanced by some acquainted with
ancient Eastern and African geography, that the Touaricks
are from Palestine, and are a portion of the tribes of the
Philistines expelled by Joshua; that the first rendezvous
of the wanderers was the oasis of <i>Oujlah</i>, which is a few
days' journey from <i>Siwah</i>, the site of the celebrated
<i>Ammonium</i>; and thence they proceeded, wandering at
will, to the west and south, peopling all the arid regions<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-182" id="V1-182"></a>[<a href="./images/1-182.png">182</a>]</span>
of the Sahara. The Sheikh of the slaves visiting me
to-day, and describing Timbuctoo, said, "It is several
times larger than Tunis; it is as large as <i>Moskou</i> (or
Russia)."</p>

<p><i>I.</i>&mdash;"Who told you <i>Moskou</i> was large?"</p>

<p><i>He.</i>&mdash;"The people."</p>

<p>So the Emperor of all the Russians may rejoice in the
consciousness, that he and his people constitute as large
a kingdom as Timbuctoo, and are celebrated in the
gossip of Saharan cities.</p>

<p>The first thing with which people break their fast in
the evening is <i>dates</i>. My taleb, when visiting me, takes
a few dates in his hands, and goes to a corner of the
court-yard, or upon the house-top, about the softening,
musing time, when the last solar rays are lingering playfully&mdash;and
to the emaciated faster, teasingly, on this
Saharan world, and there he listens in silence for the first
accents of the shrill voice of the <i>Muethan</i>, calling to
prayers, from the minaret of a neighbouring mosque.
This heard, he commences putting the dates, one by one,
slowly into his parched mouth, repeating a short prayer
with each as he swallows it with a sort of choking
difficulty. After he has eaten a dozen or so, he
drinks, and then goes off to mosque prayers. Sometimes
he prays in my house, and then comes down to dine
with me. Many people, of course, in Ghadames, never
saw a Christian before me; but they are quite as much
astonished to see a Christian eat and drink in the Ramadan,
as to see the Christian himself. This afternoon I
was very thirsty, and went to drink a little water from
one of the water-skins suspended in a square. A
woman, of half-caste, going by at the time, cried out,<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-183" id="V1-183"></a>[<a href="./images/1-183.png">183</a>]</span>
"Why, why?" I went up to her and said, "Because
you are a Mussulman and I'm a Christian." Her
astonishment was no way abated; she kept exclaiming,
"Why, why?" as if she would raise the whole city. One
of my merchant friends seeing there was some prospect
of a disturbance, came up to me and said, "Y&acirc;kob,
that woman is mad; make haste, go home." However, I
rarely ever eat and drink before the people, avoiding as
much as I can shocking their prejudices; and if asked
about fasting, usually evade the question, or say I fast or
wait for my dinner till Said can eat his dinner also.</p>

<p><i>18th.</i>&mdash;Weather has now set in cool. This morning a
little cold and raw. Now's the time for catching coughs
and cold;&mdash;people are coughing already. Just before
day-break, a thunderbolt was said to be discharged over
the city, accompanied with a long, low growling muttering
sound, which reverberated from the Saharan hills.
The circumstance remarkable, in the falling of this
dread bolt of heaven's artillery, at the time the sky was
perfectly clear and bright, and there was nothing in the
shape of storm. These discharges of sound are rare in
the Saharan regions. People asked me to explain to
them what it was, and what it prognosticated? I told
them, thunderbolts were frequent in Christian countries
during storms, and nothing of consequence follow from
them. I have reason to believe since, after conversing
with several French officers in Algeria on the subject,
that this phenomenon of a tremendous discharge of sound
was a discharge of electricity <i>from the earth</i>, which
sometimes occurs in North Africa.</p>

<p>Went to examine the Great Spring of Ghadames this
morning, which is situate on the west side of the city, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-184" id="V1-184"></a>[<a href="./images/1-184.png">184</a>]</span>
conveniently between the two grand divisions of the
population, the Ben Wezeet and the Ben Weleed. It was
to me a <i>delicium</i>. What a revolution has my opinions
undergone respecting water since I have travelled in The
Thirsty Desert! Never was such an enthusiastic conversion!
But were all conversions so harmless, how
happy for mankind! Some thirty swallows are skimming
its gaseous-bubble surface, playing off their wing-darting
delights. The Spring or Well is perennial, as
old as the foundation of the city, and may have ran for
ages before the palms were planted around it by the
hand of man, or sprung up from a few date-stones left by
some chance fugitives who had stopped to taste its
waters, and then held their way on in The Desert.
Without the Spring the city could have no existence. It
runs into a basin made and banked up for it, an oblong
square of some twenty yards by fifteen. In its deepest
part it is not more than six feet. The water is hot,
averaging a temperature of 120 degrees, and upwards, it
being too hot to bathe in near the orifices, whence the
water gushes with gaseous globules, which continually rise
from the bottom. But the orifices are not visible, and
hence an air of mystery is thrown over this spring of
"Living Water." The people say it was created by
God on the same day when the sea near Tripoli was
made. The gaseous particles are larger and more
numerous in the centre, where is the great force of the
Spring. The water is tolerably good, but a little purgative.
It is usually allowed twelve, but some give it
twenty-four hours to cool before drunk. The form of
the basin may be thus rudely represented:<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-185" id="V1-185"></a>[<a href="./images/1-185.png">185</a>]</span>&mdash;</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill1-08.jpg"><img src="./images/ill1-08_th.jpg" alt="Great Spring of Ghadames" title="Great Spring of Ghadames" /></a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">a.</span> Small bathing-places.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">b.</span> Steps where the women descend to fill their jugs
with water.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">c.</span> Corners where the water runs away to the fountains
in the squares and streets, and to the gardens, in
and without the city. Around are the ruins and backs of
houses, walls, and gardens, the palms alone being visible,
looking very fresh and gracefully picturesque, near this
source of life. After this went to see the <i>Water-Watch</i><a name="FNa_1-28" id="FNa_1-28"></a><a href="#FoN_1-28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>,
which is placed in one corner of the Souk. This is constructed
upon the same principle as the hour-glass, but it
is small, and requires to be emptied twenty-four times to
complete the hour. In fact, it is only a small earthen
pot or jar with a hole in the bottom of certain dimensions,
and when filled with water, and the water has
emptied itself, running out twenty-four times, the hour
is completed. Some gardens require the stream, which
the <i>Water-Watch</i> measures the time of the running of,
an hour, others only half an hour, and others two or
more hours, according to their size and distance from the
source. The inhabitants pay Government so much per
hour for the running of the stream into their gardens;
but some have an hereditary possession in a certain
quantity of the time of the stream's running. Of this<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-186" id="V1-186"></a>[<a href="./images/1-186.png">186</a>]</span>
they are naturally very proud. For ordinary household
purposes the water is given without cost. There are two
or three places in the town where a small water-watch is
kept, but that in the Souk is the principal one. I have
thus entered into particulars, for the obvious reason
that, "water is the liquid gold in these thirsty regions."
In Southern Algeria, the oasis of El-Agouat, each landed
proprietor has the prescriptive right of an hour or two
hours of the running of the water, according to the title
deeds of the estate. The time is measured with an
hour-glass (of sand) held by the officer who distributes
the water, and who opens and shuts the conduit of irrigation
at the time fixed. Many other oases have the
same system.</p>

<p>Some Touaricks remained, who called on me to-day.
One, who had shown himself very friendly, began to
enlarge on the dangers of the Soudan route. I immediately
observed, "God is greater than all the Touaricks."
This stopped his gab, and was applauded by the rest. A
Ghadamsee bawled out, "Oh! it requires a great deal&mdash;much,
much, much money to go to Soudan." "How
much?" I asked,&mdash;"Oh! much, much, much!" was rejoined.
"What is <i>much</i>?" "Five hundred dollars!"
was shouted out by half a dozen. I coolly observed, "It
is not much for an Englishman." Another of the Touaricks
said, about twenty years ago he saw some Englishmen
come to his country from Fezzan. What struck the
Touarick was, the English tourists gave a dollar for a
fowl, for a drink of milk, and even, he added with an
oath, for an <i>Es-Slamah &acirc;leikom</i>? ("How do you do?")
This story was told to impress me with the necessity of
taking plenty of money with me, and I was to keep up<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-187" id="V1-187"></a>[<a href="./images/1-187.png">187</a>]</span>
the liberal character of my predecessors in Saharan
travel. So we see these English tourists, who undoubtedly
were Messrs. Denham, Clapperton, and Oudney,
have spoiled the roads of travelling between Ghat and
Fezzan, as Englishmen have spoiled the routes of the
Continent of Europe. This is the propensity of John
Bull, to buy up everything and everybody abroad<a name="FNa_1-29" id="FNa_1-29"></a><a href="#FoN_1-29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>. The
Touarick added, "A deal of money is required, because
there are many banditti." He meant not exactly robbers,
but beggars, who, whilst begging, give you to understand
that their appeal to your eleemosynary feelings must
not be in vain. All who beg <i>impudently</i> on the routes, or
who levy black-mail, are called <i>Sbandout</i> ("banditti.")
But I'm more convinced than ever, that the greatest
shield of safety for the Desert traveller is his poverty.</p>

<p>Saw an aged Moorish lady, who greatly interested me.
She told me she was an hundred years old, fasted all day
long, and expected soon to go to Paradise. It is
undoubtedly a vulgar error to say the Mahometan doctrine
teaches that women have no souls. During her
hundred years, she had never seen a Christian before.
Her faculties were too weak for sectarian spite, and she
looked upon me as if I had been a simple Mussulman
stranger.</p>

<p>Sunset, this evening, a man proclaimed from the housetops
the arrival of the ghafalah, long expected from
Tripoli: only a courier arrived. By him I received the<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-188" id="V1-188"></a>[<a href="./images/1-188.png">188</a>]</span>
first letter from Tripoli, and the first newspaper, the
<i>Malta Times</i>! That mark of admiration means, gentle
reader, my poor old paper, the paper I established at so
much cost and waste of time, money, health, and labour,
for the good pleasure and caprice of The Island of Malta
and its dependencies. It's yet pleasing to see the old
paper following me; it will, perhaps, follow at my heels
to Central Africa. Ramadan began a day earlier in
Tripoli. The courier, also, brings the news, banditti are
prowling about the The Mountains attacking isolated
travellers and small caravans. I am sorry to see, by my
papers, the people advocates of their own slavery, and
that the Texans have carried through their Congress "the
Annexation with the United States," the republican
patrons and upholders of slavery and the slave-trade!
In this case, at any rate, 'it is not kings and despots
enslaving mankind,' but the people wilfully forging their
own chains. There is also a humble case before my eyes.
Here sits by my side, the slave of Haj Abd-Errahman,
who is sent every year by his master to buy and sell
goods, as if a regular free merchant. It is wonderful
fidelity on the part of this slave that he does not run
away. Unquestionably the negro has some fine qualities.
This slave, however, in palliation of the wrong,
tells me he brings few slaves, and mostly goods. I don't
fail to tell him, slaves are <i>haram</i>, ("prohibited,") to the
English. My taleb comes in, and after asking me the
news, takes up the Arabic Bible, and reads the following
beautiful prophetic sentiment:</p>

<p class="figcenter">&#8238;&#1608;&#1604;&#1603;&#1579;&#1585;&#1577; &#1575;&#1604;&#1575;&#1579;&#1605; &#1578;&#1576;&#1585;&#1583; &#1575;&#1604;&#1605;&#1581;&#1576;&#1577; &#1605;&#1606; &#1603;&#1579;&#1610;&#1585;&#8236;</p>

<p>and then asks what it means? "<i>And because iniquity</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-189" id="V1-189"></a>[<a href="./images/1-189.png">189</a>]</span>
<i>shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold</i>," I reply,
"may be illustrated in this way: Suppose the Rais buys
up or bribes the people, so that nearly all the people
applaud whatever he does, whether right or wrong, then
the love of your country, amongst you few faithful
remaining, will wax cold?"</p>

<p><i>Ben Mousa.</i>&mdash;"Yes, I understand, <i>Seedna Aysa</i>,
('our Lord Jesus,') was a prophet."</p>

<p><i>19th.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Morning</span> spent in spelling the Malta Times.
Saw a Ben-Wezeetee, who protested that all the money
of the country was in the hands of the Ben-Weleed. I
asked if he ever went to the Ben-Weleed. "For what,"
he replied angrily, "should I go to see those devils?"
In the afternoon found all the streets deserted by the
men-folks, and in possession of the women, girls, and
little children, who were playing all sorts of pranks, and
dancing and singing like so many people let loose from
Bedlam. As soon as they saw me there was a simultaneous
rush at me, all crying out, "Oh, Christian!
Christian! where's your mother? where's your sister?
where's your wife?&mdash;don't you want a wife?" Then
they began to pelt me with date-stones. I got out of
the way as quickly as possible. Wondered what in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-191" id="V1-191"></a>[<a href="./images/1-191.png">191</a>]</span>
world had become of the men. At last found them and
the boys all congregated round a mosque, this being
some important ceremony of religion.</p>

<p>I had to-day some talk about the two great political
factions, the <i>Ben-Wezeet</i> and the <i>Ben-Weleed</i>, the Whigs
and Tories of Ghadames, but pushed to such extremities
of party spirit, as almost to be without the limits of
humanity. Notwithstanding the assumed sanctity of
this holy and <i>Marabout</i> City of Ghadames, and its
actually leaving its walls to crumble away, and its gates
open to every robber of the highways of The Desert&mdash;trusting
to its prayers for its defence and to its God for
vengeance&mdash;it has nourished for centuries upon centuries
the most unnatural and fratricidal feuds within its own
bosom, dividing itself into two powerful rival factions,
and which factions, to this day, have not any <i>bon&acirc; fide</i>
social intercourse with one another. Occasionally one or
two of the rival factions privately visit each other, but
these are exceptions, and the Rais has the chiefs of the
two parties together in Divan on important business
being brought before him. In the market-place there is
likewise ground of a common and neutral rendezvous.
Abroad they also travel together, and unite against the
common enemy and the foreigner. The native Governor,
or <i>N&#257;ther</i>, and the <i>Kady</i>, are besides chosen from one or
other party, and have authority over all the inhabitants
of Ghadames. But here closes their mutual transactions.
It is a long settled time-out-of-mind, nay,
sacred rule, with them, as a whole, "Not to intermarry,
and not to visit each other's quarters, if it can possibly
be avoided." The Rais and myself, reside without the
boundaries of their respective quarters, so that we can<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-192" id="V1-192"></a>[<a href="./images/1-192.png">192</a>]</span>
be visited by both parties, who often meet together accidentally
in our houses. The Arab suburb is also neutral
ground. Most of the poor strangers take up their residence
here. The <i>Ben-Wezeet</i> have four streets and the
<i>Ben-Weleed</i> three. These streets have likewise their
subdivisions and chiefs, but live amicably with one another,
so far as I could judge. The people generally are
very shy of conversing with strangers about their ancient
immemorial feuds. I could only learn from the young
men that in times past the two factions fought together
with arms, and "some dreadful deeds were done." My
taleb only wrote the following when I asked him to give
some historical information respecting these factions:&mdash;"The
Ben Weleed and the Ben Wezeet are people of
Ghadames, who have quarrelled from time immemorial:
it was the will of God they should be divided, and who
shall resist his will? Y&acirc;kob, be content to know this!"</p>

<p>But the Rais boasts of having done something to
mitigate the mutual antipathies of the factions. "The
<i>Sham&#257;tah</i>, between them," he says, "has had its neck
broken." And really, if it be the case, there is in this
some compensation for the wrongs and miseries which
the Turks are inflicting upon an impoverished and over
burthened people. In other parts of Northern Sahara
similar factions exist, often arising from chance divisions
of towns. There is a similar division of the town of
Ghabs in Tunis, but not carried to such extreme lengths as
these factions of Ghadames. It would seem that society
could not exist without party and divisions no more than
a British Parliament. Even Scripture intimates there
must be strifes and divisions.</p>

<p>Many came to me to hear the news from Tripoli and<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-193" id="V1-193"></a>[<a href="./images/1-193.png">193</a>]</span>
Algeria. I found them all interested in the fate and
fortunes of the latter country. Some vague rumours
had reached them of serious and bloody skirmishes. I
calmed them, telling them "all people were on an equal
footing in Algeria, Christians as Mussulmans, even as
Mussulmans were in our British India." Some doubted
my information. Late in the evening, when the visitors of
the Rais had retired, I had a t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te with his Excellency.
Speaking of the Ghadamseeah, his Excellency
said, "They are ignorant and know not the <i>tareek</i> (<i>i. e.</i>,
system) of the Sultan; they magnify every trifle of news
they hear, and are now alive to every change, and in
feverish expectation of some new event." This is always
the case with the oppressed; they must love change, if
but for the worse. His Excellency then continued:
"Since the forced contribution of fifty thousand dollars, no
money is to be found. The money due for the past
four months is still uncollected." Speaking of the bandits,
his Excellency said, "The Pasha has written to me
that he cannot allow me, or the Commandant of The
Mountains, to march out against the <i>Seb&acirc;ah</i> or <i>Sh&acirc;nbah</i>,
without an order from the Sultan, but with such an order
we could soon exterminate them." Our Rais does not
entirely neglect the intellectual edification of his Desert
subjects. This evening, early, he amused them with
talking about steamboats, or "boats of fire." I put in
a word about railroads, telling them with a railway we
could come from Tripoli to Ghadames in two days. "The
Christians know all things but God," said a Marabout.</p>

<p><i>20th.</i>&mdash;Weather is now cool, and I can walk about
the gardens at mid-day without inconvenience. I enjoy
this much, amusing myself with throwing stones at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-194" id="V1-194"></a>[<a href="./images/1-194.png">194</a>]</span>
ripe dates, which fall in luscious clusters into one's
mouth. Eating fruit in the gardens or from the trees is
also a peculiar delight enjoyed by people of all countries
and climates. Several of the people are so ignorant
of printing that they call my newspapers letters, and this
is natural enough, as there are no other but manuscript
books amongst them.&mdash;&#8238;&#1587;&#1605;&#1593;&#1575;&#1606; &#1575;&#1604;&#1575;&#1576;&#1585;&#1589;&#8236;, "Simon <i>the
Leper</i>" (Matt. xxvi.). It is usual here to distinguish
people in this way: as "Mohammed, <i>the one-eyed</i>,"
"Ahmed, <i>the lame-with-one-leg</i>," and "Mustapha, <i>the
red-beard</i>." So the famous pirate of the Mediterranean
was called "<i>Barbarossa</i>." The people are not at all
ashamed of being called by their natural deformities, as
we are in Europe. <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads '&#8238;&#1602;&#1607;&#1602;&#1605;&#8236;'">&#8238;&#1602;&#1605;&#1602;&#1605;&#8236;</ins> is one of the numerous words
in Arabic where the sound corresponds with the sense.
<i>Ghemghem</i> is, "to murmur," and the English word itself
is not a bad example of the kind. The Mussulmans
have very grotesque notions of the Christian doctrine of
Trinity. A person said: "Do not the Christians say
God has a Son?" "Yes," I replied. The rejoinder was,
"That is making God like a bullock (&#8238;&#1576;&#1602;&#1585;&#8236;)!" My friend
the Touatee, a native of Touat, tells me the Touaricks
were originally from Timbuctoo, and so say all Touat
Touaricks. The ghafalah just arrived from Tripoli has
brought eighty camel-loads of barley. Observed the
head of the little son of the Touarick bandit. Fancied
it was really the infantile cast of such a parent's head.
This is the danger of the science, prejudicing you in
such matters.</p>

<p>Apparently, what little thieving there is going on here
is committed by the Arabs and slaves. There are three
or four of these latter most determined date stealers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-195" id="V1-195"></a>[<a href="./images/1-195.png">195</a>]</span>
One of these slaves was brought up yesterday and received
two hundred bastinadoes; but it had not much
effect upon him. When these offenders become incurable,
the Rais packs them off to Tripoli. A very good plan,
which keeps the country free of offences of petty larceny.
However, many of these slaves steal because
they have not enough to eat: thus we come to the old
circle again, that poverty is the mother of crime. So is
it with the Arabs and slaves of Ghadames. The slaves
are mostly devout, if not fanatic Mussulmans. They
have a right to be fanatical, for their religion is a great
protection to them. Their masters, not like the <i>Christian</i>
slave-masters of the Southern States of America,
who close the Bible against the slave, are also proud of
the fanaticism of their slaves, and teach them verses of
the Koran. The slave's conception of the dogmas of his
religion is slow and confused. My Negro Said is a good
Mussulman, and keeps his fast well, but I never yet
caught him at his prayers, nor does he go much to the
mosque. Yesterday I came suddenly upon two youngsters,
the Rais's slaves, who at mid-day were devouring
roasted locusts and drinking water, in the style of
sumptuous feasting. I called out, "Holloa! how now?
are you feasting or fasting?" They began laughing and
then handed me some roast locusts, to bribe me not to
blab. My taleb caught a slave in my house eating also
roasted locusts, and asked him if he should like to be
roasted in hell-fire?</p>

<p><i>21st.</i>&mdash;The old blind man is the most regular patient.
The novelty of being doctored or quacked by a Christian
is wearing away. Wrote to-day to Mr. Gagliuffi, British
Vice-Consul of Mourzuk. Said, in visiting his friends,<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-196" id="V1-196"></a>[<a href="./images/1-196.png">196</a>]</span>
for he has now <i>his circle</i>, brought me a present of <i>Danzagou</i>,
in Arabic <i>Kashkash</i>. This is a seed of the size
of a large hip, and of a beautiful scarlet colour; it is
used sometimes as medicine, mostly for necklace beads,
and is native of Soudan, where it abounds. He also
brought some <i>Morrashee</i>, in Arabic <i>Jidglan</i>. This is a
species of millet, a product of Soudan. The Blacks,
Moors, and Arabs all eat it with <i>gusto</i>. There are
several varieties of edible seed brought over The Desert
from Soudan, chiefly as Saharan luxuries. Had a long
conversation with the people of the <i>Ben-Weleed</i>, and
found them extremely sociable. One of them had been
to Leghorn, and described the houses as seven stories
high, and the port <i>free</i>. These were his strongest impressions.
It is worth observing here the universal freemasonry
of the mercantile spirit. As a merchant, he
could understand and recollect a free-port in any part of
the world. The honour of this anecdote have the
Leaguers.</p>

<p>A man showed me a sore place on his arm, which he
called <i>Arak</i><a name="FNa_1-30" id="FNa_1-30"></a><a href="#FoN_1-30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a><i>-El-Abeed</i> (&#8238;&#1593;&#1585;&#1603; &#1575;&#1604;&#1593;&#1576;&#1610;&#1583;&#8236;). This was a large
raised pimple, in the centre of which was an opening,
and from which aperture there issued from time to time
a very fine worm, like the finest silk-thread, and sometimes
not much thicker than a spider's web, in small
detached lengths. This worm is often of the enormous
length of twenty yards, gradually oozing out piecemeal.
It is a common disease of Soudan where the merchants<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-197" id="V1-197"></a>[<a href="./images/1-197.png">197</a>]</span>
catch the infection, and bring it over The Desert. It is
said to be acquired principally by drinking the waters of
that country.</p>

<p>By the wars before the occupation of the Turks, Tripoli
had become exhausted of its wealth, and its trade
and agriculture were at the lowest ebb. The country
was divided into two armed factions of the ancient
family, money was borrowed at the most extravagant, and
sometimes 500 per cent. interest, and the jewels of the ancient
family were bartered away for arms and provisions,
to carry on the war. A large collection of splendid
diamonds were sold for something like an old song.
Most of these got into the hands of Europeans. I saw
some in the hands of an European gentleman, who
assured me that he had been fortunate enough to get
them for a fourth, and some of them for a seventh, of
their value. When the Turks usurped the Government,
such was the condition of the country. But they
had also to put down a formidable rebellion of the Arabs,
which occupied several years of exterminating war.
This gave the <i>coup de gr&acirc;ce</i> to the unfortunate Regency
of Tripoli, and plunged it into complete ruin. There
was, however, one city, far in The Desert, which appeared
unaffected by these sanguinary and wasting
revolutions&mdash;the holy-merchant-marabout city of Ghadames!
the pacific character of whose inhabitants seemed
to place it without the pale of such dire turmoils. But
the Turks (the war with the Arabs ended, and at leisure)
began to look about, and thought they saw an
Eldorado looming beautifully in the <i>mirage</i> of The
Desert, which would speedily replenish their exhausted
treasures, and put the Government of Tripoli in easy<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-198" id="V1-198"></a>[<a href="./images/1-198.png">198</a>]</span>
pecuniary circumstances. A pretext was soon found to
excavate in this newly discovered Desert mine. "The
people of Ghadames," said the Pashas of Tripoli, "are
rebels&mdash;they sympathized with the Arabs&mdash;they did
not come forward to help us to exterminate the Arabs&mdash;they
must now pay for their disaffection." A forced
contribution was therefore immediately levied upon them
of 50,000 mahboubs and upwards, and the women and
children were stripped of their gold and silver ornaments,
and houses ransacked, to make up the amount at
once. Ten thousand mahboubs were also demanded annually.
This new demand threw the city into consternation,
and the men brought out the women and the children
into the streets, who fell upon their faces before
the officers of the Pasha, and implored them not to
deprive their wives and children of bread. It was at
last settled they should pay 6,250 mahboubs, as an annual
contribution. Under the Caramanly dynasty they
paid only some 850 mahboubs per annum, besides being
left to the uncontrolled management of their own affairs.
Now, whilst the people are complaining of the large
amount of taxation imposed upon them, and pleading
their impossibility to pay up arrears&mdash;in this irritable
state of things&mdash;an order comes from Ahmed Effendi in
The Mountains, to collect an additional contribution of
3,225 mahboubs, under the pretext of its being wanted
to maintain troops in Fezzan, and keep open the communications
of commerce. This intelligence has so completely
astounded the few remaining merchants who have
any money, that they nearly lost their senses, yesterday
and to-day, being very ill, and unable to attend to their
ordinary business. The money for the last four months<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-199" id="V1-199"></a>[<a href="./images/1-199.png">199</a>]</span>
is not yet collected, and the people say they cannot pay
up. Our Rais has three times represented to the Pasha
the inability of the people, but the answer always is,
"<i>money must be had</i>." I expect to witness some cruel
scenes of extortion practised before I leave this place,
like what I saw in The Mountains<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: removed superfluous quotation mark">.</ins> I observe now the
Rais can't keep a respectable collector. <i>No native of
Ghadames will collect for him.</i> Sometimes he sends the
Arab soldiers, who abuse the defaulters. Once an Arab
soldier got hold of a poor man in the street, an acquaintance
of mine, to drag him off before the Rais. I
told him to stop a moment, and then having ascertained
how much it was&mdash;about one shilling and eight-pence&mdash;paid
the money and got the poor fellow clear this time.
Sheikh Makouran is a true patriot. Whenever he sees
anybody dragged off in this way through the streets, in
spite of the Governor, and his being a member of the
Divan, he takes upon himself to impede the course of
justice (<i>extortion?</i>), abuses with all his might the officer,
and if he can't rescue the defaulter, pays the money
himself: so strives for public liberty this Hampden of
The Desert!</p>

<p>To-day, had a proof of the rancorous enmity of the
ancient factions. A merchant of the Ben Welleed, who
wished to visit me, said, "I must come round the city,
for <i>I don't know</i> the streets of the Ben Wezeet. Thank
God! I never went through them in my life." This he
said with vehemence, intimating that he never would
enter the streets of the Ben Wezeet as long as he lived.
A ghafalah has arrived from the oases of Fezzan, bringing
corn and dates, productions abundant in those countries.<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-200" id="V1-200"></a>[<a href="./images/1-200.png">200</a>]</span></p>

<p><i>22nd.</i>&mdash;Weather continues cool. Few more patients.
Present of dates from one of them. Very little meat
now killed in Ghadames, less and less every day. What
will become of this once flourishing city it is hard to tell.
The prejudices of the people against the residence of an
European in this city have apparently disappeared;
people are increasingly civil; many would willingly look
upon me as their protector, were I made Consul, but
unfortunately for them, I am not ambitious of, nor have
any inclination for, the honour.</p>

<p>This morning heard a curious opinion about Younas,
or Jonas (Jonah), for the Arabs, like the Greeks<a name="FNa_1-31" id="FNa_1-31"></a><a href="#FoN_1-31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>, sometimes
change the last letter of the Hebrew &#1492; into a <ins class="grk" title="Greek: S">&#931;</ins>.
Probably they got their traditions through the Greeks or
the Greek language. I was talking with a taleb about
longevity, when he observed, "There is but one person
who is always alive." "Who is that?" I inquired very
anxiously. "It is our lord Jonas, who is living in
<i>distant</i> and <i>unknown</i> parts of the world," he said. "Is
he alone?" I further inquired. "No," he added, "he
has with him a hundred thousand people, who live to a
great age, but who at last die, whilst he is always living.
Then as to Jesus, the son of Mary, he also never died,
and went up to heaven alive. The Jews (the curse of
God upon them!) only killed his <i>likeness</i>." I have
always observed these mysterious events to transpire in
some <i>unknown</i> and <i>distant</i> part of the world, and took
the liberty of telling this taleb that the "smoke-ships"
(steamers) could soon make every place in the world
near and known, and then we might find out the resi<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-201" id="V1-201"></a>[<a href="./images/1-201.png">201</a>]</span>dence
of Jonah as well as the captivity of the ten tribes.
The story of the ten tribes is pretty well known. A
Maroquine rabbi told me they are somewhere about the
regions of Gog and Magog, in Central Asia, situate in a
country where there is a river running perpetually six
days out of seven, very rapid and full of stones, so that
they cannot pass it and return to the Holy Land. On
the seventh it stops, when it might be passed, but on the
Sabbath day the law does not permit them to travel.
This is the Barbary version. Central Asia is still the
land of mysteries for both Jews and Mohammedans.
The Russians have done little to dispel these mysteries,
if they have not tried to envelop these lands in profounder
obscurity, for political purposes; but had we
been established in Affghanistan, we might have discovered
<i>Jibel Kaf</i>, the retreat of Gog and Magog, the
strange stony river, the ten tribes, and all the other
objects of Jewish and Mohammedan superstition. But
as with the famous gardens of the Hesperides, the abode
of perfectly happy mortals, which were shifted farther
and farther from actual observation by the progress of
ancient discovery, so the mysterious retreat of the ten
tribes and the ever-living Jonas will be transferred to
other unknown lands when modern discovery shall have
exhausted Central Asia.</p>

<p>Met Sheikh Makouran: asked him what was to be
done to meet the extraordinary contribution. He said
he couldn't tell, people had no money: Rais had so
written to Tripoli, but was reprimanded by the Pasha.
Advised him to send a deputation to the Pasha, or the
British Consul-General. Had another example of the
bad system of collecting monies, as often in Mahometan<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-202" id="V1-202"></a>[<a href="./images/1-202.png">202</a>]</span>
States, by means of common soldiers. These fellows do
all the dirty jobs, everything necessary in the way of
extortion; the more respectable officials shun these disagreeable
transactions, especially if they be natives of
the place where the taxes are collected. A great disturbance
was in the streets, the people almost fighting
with these extortioner ruffians. Going farther on, something
absolutely ludicrous happened. The soldiers could
not read, no person would read their papers for them,
and they could not find out the person on whom they
were to make their demands, although the parties were
actually present. They then came to me to read their
papers. I asked them, "Whether they thought it showed
any of the friendship which they professed towards me
to embroil me with the people of the country, whose
hospitality I was receiving?" They were so convinced
of the justice of my appeal, that they went off without
replying. A Ghadamsee peasant called to me, "Y&acirc;cob,
you must be our Consul!"</p>

<p>Afternoon, Essnousee left for Ghat. Being extremely
attached to this merchant, I went to see him off. About
thirty of the Ben Weleed (for he is of this faction) accompanied
him, the most respectable of this division of the
the city; I was glad to see a person, in whom hereafter
I might have to place implicit confidence, so much
esteemed. His friends set to and loaded his camel
before starting, as many as could find any thing, each
taking an article of harness or equipment. This I
observed often afterwards. It is reckoned friendly.
By such conduct they show they are willing to render all
the assistance in their power to their friend. I continued
on the route of Ghat with Essnousee half an hour<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-203" id="V1-203"></a>[<a href="./images/1-203.png">203</a>]</span>
or more, bade him farewell and returned. His brothers
and a slave left him with me. The merchant then proceeded
on his desert journey of some fifteen or twenty
days <i>absolutely alone</i>, for he had only a Touarick camel-driver.
This demonstrates the security of the route. I
said to the people afterwards, "Is he not afraid to go
alone?" "No," was the answer, "they will only meet
Touaricks, and these are our friends. You have only to
pay a small trifle of toll in different parts of the route
and you are quite safe. Sometimes you don't pay this."
Essnousee will reach Ghat in twelve, whilst a quick caravan
requires from eighteen to twenty days. With first-rate
camels the journey could be performed in <i>eight</i> or ten days.
Strange infatuation! I felt an almost irrepressible desire
to accompany Essnousee <i>as I was</i>, and to plunge anew
into all the hardships and dangers of The Desert. But
such is man, a creature of daring or absurd impulses!
and the more he moves, and roams, and rambles, the
more (in modern phrase) <i>locomotive</i> he is&mdash;the less he
likes repose, and seeks unceasingly such perilous stimulants.
Observed, on returning, amongst the loose stones
scattered upon the surface of The Desert, a great quantity
of rubbish, like brick-bats thrown out from a brick-kiln,
giving the face of the ground a burnt and volcanic
appearance. Picked some up and could hardly believe
but what they were burnt bricks. The Ben Weleed,
who accompanied Essnousee, instead of the short and
direct road through the streets of the Ben Wezeet, took
a circuitous route round the inner walls of the city to
arrive at the gate of departure, showing me how great
was still the force of these factions. Essnousee himself
told me he never went through the streets of the Ben<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-204" id="V1-204"></a>[<a href="./images/1-204.png">204</a>]</span>
Wezeet, nor did he expect he ever should in this
world.</p>

<p><i>24th.</i>&mdash;Yesterday and to-day employed in writing for
the <i>Shantah</i> (Turkish, for mail). Rais in a good humour
this evening. Two camels came in from The Sahara, one
day's journey, laden with wood for the Rais. His Excellency
offered some to me. The fact is, I purchased a camel-load
a few days ago, and his Excellency's servants had
nearly begged it all away. People generally burn dried
and dead branches of the palm, which, in this season, is
abundant. It is not good fire-wood; there is plenty of
flame and smoke, but little heat. Said, on my return
from the Rais, assures me he has heard from his visitors,
the Touarick slaves, that now the Touaricks do not beat
their slaves, but esteem all men <i>souwa, souwa</i>, ("equal");
it was not so in former times. Free and enlightened
America may have yet to learn lessons of freedom and
humanity from the savages of The Sahara!</p>

<p>Purchased a <i>Thob</i><a name="FNa_1-32" id="FNa_1-32"></a><a href="#FoN_1-32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>, a species of large lizard. It is
common in The Sahara. The Touaricks eat them, and
say they are <i>medicine</i> for a pain or weakness in the
back. This may have been surmised from the ideal
resemblance between the strength of their backs, which is
scaly and bony, and strongly bound together, and the
strength it is likely to communicate unto persons having
a weak or crippled spine. They are pretty good eating,
and taste something like the kid of the goat; the tail is
esteemed the greatest delicacy. I tasted of this which I
bought, and liked it. There is no lizard of this species
in Soudan. A Touarick told me that, having found one<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-205" id="V1-205"></a>[<a href="./images/1-205.png">205</a>]</span>
in The Desert, he carried it to Soudan, where a Negro
prince fell in love with it, and gave him for it the present
of a young female slave. The Arabs tame the
Thob, and he grows very fond. Some of them are very
large. This I purchased is only twenty inches in length,
and about ten round the thickest part of the body. The
head is large and tortoise-shaped, with a small mouth. It
is covered with scales, or "scaly mail," and its tail is about
four inches long, composed of a series of broad thick and
sharp bones. It has four feet, or rather <i>hands</i>, for, as
the Arabs say, "It has hands like <i>Ben-Adam</i> (mankind)."
All the body, back and flanks, are covered by
shining scales, of the colour of a darked-spotted grey,
with spots white and light under the belly. It runs
very awkwardly on account of its bulky tail, and to look
at is a miniature aligator or crocodile. It is almost
harmless, fighting a little now and then; its appearance,
however, is rather forbidding. It hides in the dry sandy
holes of The Sahara. A drop of water, say the Arabs,
would hurt it. The traditions of the Mohammedans
mention that Mahomet did not himself eat the Thob, at
the same time he did not prohibit it to his followers.
The Saharan merchants, in traversing The Desert, frequently
make a good meal of the Thob. Whilst talking
of the Thob, the people said the flesh of parrots was
<i>poison</i> for Ben-Adam.</p>

<p><i>25th.</i>&mdash;Another of my patients dead, of a raging
fever caught, it is said, "by sleeping on the top of the
house in the open air." The moon struck him, they say.
According to the Psalms, "The sun shall not smite thee
by day, nor <i>the moon by night</i>."</p>

<p>They let him remain seven days without sending for<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-206" id="V1-206"></a>[<a href="./images/1-206.png">206</a>]</span>
me, when it was too late to administer my fever powders.
I fetched an old gentleman who could bleed to have him
bled, but they refused, saying it was now late. The
old blood-letter vexed at their refusal, said, "Well, if I
mustn't bleed him, let me pray for him;" and, immediately
offered up a short prayer, in which they all joined
willingly. On telling a Ghadamsee I ate some Thob, he
said, "Ah, that's forbidden; the Thob was formerly a
human being, before it had its present shape. Don't you
see its hands are still <i>human</i>?" The notion of the
transmigration of souls lingers in these parts, but it is a
doctrine not generally received. I observed this man
afterwards fattening his sheep with date-stones, broken
into small pieces. Almost every family, however small,
have their sheep to fatten. Pounded date-stones are also
given to camels for fattening. Writing for amusement
with my taleb, I recollected a verse in the Koran, which
I wrote:&mdash;</p>

<p class="figcenter">&#8238;&#1575;&#1585;&#1587;&#1604;&#1606;&#1575;&#1603; &#1575;&#1604;&#1617;&#1575; &#1585;&#1581;&#1605;&#1577; &#1604;&#1604;&#1593;&#1604;&#1605;&#1610;&#1606;&#8236;</p>

<p>This filled him with surprise and horror, and he immediately
scratched it out, as too pure and holy a thing to
be in the possession of an Infidel. The translation is:&mdash;"We
(God) have sent thee (Mahomet) only for mercy to
mankind;" or, "Thy mission to man, O Mahomet! is
only mercy." Such credit all impostors and pretenders
to revelation claim for themselves, and such an object
they declare to be the end of their mission, although at
the same time, and in the same breath, they don't forget
to doom all those who reject their authority to perdition.
This, it would seem, is a necessary evil in propagating
new religions and new sects. But enough of this&mdash;may<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-207" id="V1-207"></a>[<a href="./images/1-207.png">207</a>]</span>
the world grow more kindly&mdash;let us hope it will. This
morning arrived a single Arab from Fezzan. It would
appear extreme hardihood when we reflect, that for nine
days, there is not a house, and scarcely a resting-place.
The Arab was mounted on a camel. This arrival, as
Essnousee's departure, shows the security of the routes
in some directions. The Arab told me he made his
journey in nine days, and stopped occasionally on the
road to sleep and refresh himself. In the night he tied
his camel's leg to his own leg, so that if it attempted to
stray, it would awake him.</p>

<p>Nothing new with Rais. Speaking of the Arabs, he
says, "You know Arabs to be very devils. There are
two ways to consider Arabs, but whichever way they
are robbers and assassins. When they are famished, they
plunder in order to eat; when their bellies are full, they
plunder because they kick and are insolent. Now, we
(Turks) keep them upon low diet in The Mountains; they
have little, and always a little food. This is the Sultan's
<i>tareek</i> (government) to manage them. Their
spirits are kept down and broken, and they are submissive."
He then told me he had held a Divan to obtain
the extra contribution of 3,200 mahboubs, for the Pasha;
but the people protested they could not pay such an
amount. I wrote a letter to Colonel Warrington, stating
this circumstance, and asked him if he could assist the
people in any way. I thought it a bare possibility that
the hand of foreign diplomacy might be stretched out to
save this city, which had flourished in the pursuits of its
own peaceful commerce for more than a thousand years.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. To
mitigate the apparent harshness of his demand,
the Rais observed, that before the Sultan occupied<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-208" id="V1-208"></a>[<a href="./images/1-208.png">208</a>]</span>
Ghadames, the country between this and Tripoli was
full of banditti. "The Arabs of The Mountains," he
added, "were all banditti, those amongst whom you
resided eight days. The Touaricks were not so bad, they
generally protected Ghadamsee merchants. Now since
the Sultan, there are only the Sh&acirc;nbah and the Seb&acirc;ah,
therefore the Ghadamseeah must pay." So, <i>Audi alteram
partem</i>.</p>

<p><i>26th.</i>&mdash;To-day, resident thirty days in Ghadames
which time I have certainly not lost. Written a good
deal of MS., such as it is, and several letters; besides,
applied myself to reading and writing Arabic. Likewise
distributed medicines to a considerable number of invalids.
Wish to pass the next month as profitably as the
month gone. My expenses of living, including a guard to
sleep in the house at night, and Said, are only at the
rate of eighteen-pence per day; this, however, excludes
tea, coffee, and sugar. Besides, Sheikh Makouran refuses
to take anything for house-rent, saying, "It would be
against the will of God to receive money from you, who
are our sure friend, and our guest of hospitality." Few
patients, in comparison with the past. As the winter
approaches, the cases of ophthalmia are less. In the
precipitation of leaving Tripoli, brought little ink with
me, and most of that I gave away; so am obliged to go
about the town to beg a little. The custom is, when
one person wants ink, he begs it of another. Went to
Ben Weleed, who procured me a supply.</p>

<p>My intercourse has been mostly with Ben Wezeet,
but to day I visited <i>Ben Weleed</i> at the <i>Bab-Es-Sagheer</i>,
("the little gate,") or the <i>Bab-Es-Saneeah</i>, ("the gate
of the garden,") where there were about forty of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-209" id="V1-209"></a>[<a href="./images/1-209.png">209</a>]</span>
most respectable of this faction assembled in a sort of gossiping
divan amongst themselves. They told me they met
here every morning, and chatted over the news of the previous
day. Usually they meet just after sunrise, and certainly
in this way they pass a cool and fragrant hour, full
of the odoriferous breathings of the gardens as the day is
awakening. I asked one, who were the richer, the
Weleed or the Wezeet? He replied, with an honourable
frankness, "The <i>Wezeet</i>." Observed many of the men
had their eyelids blackened, like the women, with <i>Kohel</i><a name="FNa_1-33" id="FNa_1-33"></a><a href="#FoN_1-33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>,
and also their finger-nails and toe-nails dyed dark-red
with henna<a name="FNa_1-34" id="FNa_1-34"></a><a href="#FoN_1-34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>. I confessed I was surprised at this monstrous
effeminacy. One of these <i>lady</i>-gentlemen was the
son of the powerful Ettanee family; he was brought up
to the Church, and of great promise, bidding fair to be
future Kady or Archbishop. He put a curious question
to me, "How much is the expense of a journey from
Malta to Constantinople?" When I satisfied him, he
said, "I shall go and buy some slaves at Ghat, and then
convey them to Constantinople. Don't you think I shall
make money by it?" I told him he would not find
anybody at Malta to convey slaves to Constantinople;
and if he took them there, they would be set at liberty, for
a slave once touching British territory became free. To
this he replied only, "I know&mdash;I knew before." I was
extremely glad he did know it. It is strange to see a
young man of this description so avariciously turn himself<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-210" id="V1-210"></a>[<a href="./images/1-210.png">210</a>]</span>
into a slave-dealer, but Mohammedan priests frequently
trade.</p>

<p>Marabouts in The Mountains are mostly camel-drivers;
and the greater part of priests, marabouts, and kadys
perform sacred duties gratis. An order of priesthood
exists, though it is not kept up very distinctly from laymen,
but it is an honour to them, "to work in the service
of God for nothing," and is worthy of the imitation of
Christians. My new clerical friend gave me a dissertation
upon things having two names, a classical one and
a vulgar one. The Kohel is also called <i>Athmed</i>, &#8238;&#1575;&#1579;&#1605;&#1583;&#8236;,
which is its classical name. Senna is called <i>hasheeshah</i>,
&#8238;&#1581;&#1588;&#1610;&#1588;&#1607;&#8236;, literally "herbs," its vulgar name, and &#8238;&#1587;&#1606;&#1575; &#1581;&#1585;&#1605;&#8236;,
"senna of <i>Mecca</i>," (literally, of the inviolable,) which is
its classical name. A little senna is found casually in
the gardens of Ghadames; but the country of Senna, in
The Sahara, is Aheer, where it is cultivated by the
Touaricks. He pointed out to me the <i>Tout</i>, (&#8238;&#1578;&#1608;&#1578;&#8236;,) the
small white mulberry, which is planted in little squares
of the city. Speaking of the Touaricks, he said: "These
people are getting dissatisfied with us. Formerly we
paid them better; but being robbed of our money by
the Turks, we can't give them much. They smell also a
disagreeable odour now. Formerly they came in and
went out our city as a garden." "What odour is that?"
I asked. "<i>It's that Rais</i>," he whispered in my ear. The
fact is, the Touaricks felt themselves more at home before
the Turks came here, which everybody can imagine.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill1-09.jpg"><img src="./images/ill1-09_th.jpg" alt="Bas-Relief" title="Bas-Relief" /></a></p>

<p>This afternoon, whilst talking with the people about
their antiquities, one of them said, "There are some
figures remaining." I immediately asked him to show
them to me. The youngster volunteered; and, to my<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-211" id="V1-211"></a>[<a href="./images/1-211.png">211</a>]</span>
great joy, I was taken off to a garden, where I saw the
<i>bas-relief</i> drawn above. I then thought about getting it
in a quiet way to my house; so I went up to the owner
of the garden in which it lay, and said to him in a very
careless, indifferent manner, "What's the good of the
stone to you&mdash;you may give it me; perhaps it will be of
some use." The man replied at once, "Aye, Christian,
take it." The youngster, who was a stout fellow, brought
it off forthwith upon his head. I followed him in secret
triumph, thinking myself very fortunate; for if any noise
had been made, I should have had to pay several dollars
for it, whatever might have been its real value, and, perhaps,
not have got it at all. Indeed, some of the people
were very jealous; and when I returned, they called out
<i>flous! flous!</i> ("money! money!") They thought I
had got a rich prize, and I hope I have. I told them, if
anybody had any <i>flous</i>, it would be the owner of the
garden, who gave me the slab. The sketch represents,
apparently, a soldier holding or feeding a horse, but of
what age and country I shall not pretend to say, leaving<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-212" id="V1-212"></a>[<a href="./images/1-212.png">212</a>]</span>
that to antiquarians. It is broken off half, and otherwise
pecked and mutilated by the people. It is a pious act
of religion to deface stones representing figures of any
sort, to decapitate heads of statues, and destroy every
shape and symbol of the human likeness, not excepting
likenesses of animals. An old Ghadamsee doctor,
very fond of me, was, however, extremely glad when he
saw me in possession of the slab. He kept saying, "Ah,
Y&acirc;kob, that's your grandfathers (ancestors). See! isn't
it wonderful? Ah, that's your grandfathers of the time
of <i>Sidi Nimrod</i>. Take it home with you. Ah, that's
your grandfathers!"</p>

<p>This evening, heard that the heads of the people of
Ghadames had adopted my suggestion of sending a deputation
to Tripoli, to state their inability to meet the
new and extraordinary demand of 3,200 mahboubs, the
Governor consenting to their determination.</p>

<p><i>27th.</i>&mdash;Weather still cool and pleasant, but the flies
are in great numbers, and very disagreeable. Am
obliged always to have my room darkened when I write,
to keep them from tormenting me. They increase as the
dates ripen, and soon after the dates are gathered in,
they disappear, and not one is to be found during the
winter. Haj Mansour gave me to-day a <i>meneshsha</i>
(&#8238;&#1605;&#1606;&#1588;&#1617;&#1575;&#8236;) or fly-flap, made of the long flowing beard of
the Wadan. It is a most effective whipper-away of the
flies. It instantly disperses them, the fine strong hair of
the Wadan's beard hitting them like pins and needles.
This species of fly-flap is greatly valued in Soudan, where
it sells at a high price. The hairs which are of a dull grey
or red brown, are usually dyed with henna when made
up into fly-flaps. I expressed myself extremely obliged<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-213" id="V1-213"></a>[<a href="./images/1-213.png">213</a>]</span>
to the Haj. <i>Wadan</i> (Ar. &#8238;&#1608;&#1583;&#1575;&#1606;&#8236;), <i>Oudad</i> (Berber &#8238;&#1575;&#1608;&#1583;&#1575;&#1583;&#8236;),
and English <i>Mouflon</i>, is the name of a species of animals
between the goat and the bullock<a name="FNa_1-35" id="FNa_1-35"></a><a href="#FoN_1-35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>. It is common in the
Southern Atlas of Morocco, and is hunted in the neighbouring
sands of Ghadames during winter by the Souf
Arabs, and brought in and sold for butcher's meat.
Wadan is said to be <i>medicine</i> by the people, and tastes
like high flavoured coarse venison. Three or four only
have been sent to England<a name="FNa_1-36" id="FNa_1-36"></a><a href="#FoN_1-36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>. Dr. Russell, in his <i>Barbary
States</i>, makes it to <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'resembles'">resemble</ins> a calf, but it rather
resembles a large goat or a horned sheep. Besides the
<i>Wadan</i> and the <i>Thob</i>, Saharan people eat many animals
which hungry Europeans might eat, amongst the rest
rats and mice, when in good condition. But the mouse
is the large mouse of The Sahara. The Rais had a live
Wadan which died just before my arrival. He regretted
much as he would have given it to me. His Excellency
promises to get me one.</p>

<p><i>Nimrod</i> is always in the mouths of the Ghadamseeah
as the founder of their city. They are especially fond
of calling him a <i>Christian</i>. He is often called my grandfather,
although I have not yet been able to trace my
descent in a direct line from so august a progenitor. The
European reader recollects where he is mentioned in
the Jewish early records,&mdash;</p>

<p class="figcenter">&#8238;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; &#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1464;&#1492; &#1504;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1431;&#1470;&#1510;&#1463;&#1497;&#1460;&#1491; &#1500;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;&#1470;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;&#8236;</p>

<p>"He was a mighty hunter before the Lord." Gen. x. 9.
In the Arabic translation the word employed for<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-214" id="V1-214"></a>[<a href="./images/1-214.png">214</a>]</span>
"mighty" is the same as that of the Hebrew, <i>i. e.</i> &#8238;&#1580;&#1576;&#1617;&#1575;&#1585;&#8236;
the &#8238;&#1580;&#8236; representing the &#8238;&#1490;&#8236;, omitting any word to correspond
with &#8238;&#1510;&#1497;&#1491;&#8236;; but the Moors understand generally by
the term &#8238;&#1580;&#1576;&#1617;&#1575;&#1585;&#8236;, "a tyrant" and "a conqueror." So
Hammoudah Bashaw, the great Bey of Tunis, is called
by a faithful Tunisian historian of that country, a &#8238;&#1580;&#1576;&#1617;&#1575;&#1585;&#8236;.
But, perhaps, in those remote times, the hunter and the
tyrant, as in the Roman Commodus, were joined in one
and the same person. Certainly this is the natural sense
of the combination of the terms &#8238;&#1490;&#1489;&#1512;&#1470;&#1510;&#1497;&#1491;&#8236;. To this might
easily be added man-hunter and slave-maker, a worthy
attribute of Nimrod. The gentlemen of the turf, of the
Bentinck school, ought, however to protest against this
supposition. Properly Nimrod is the Hercules of the
Moors of North Africa. According to them he emerged
from the East, overran and founded several cities in The
Sahara, conquered all before him, put his feet upon the
neck of all nations, and then passed the Straits of the
Roman and Grecian Hercules, and built the far-famed
Andalous (Spain), as also Paris and London, and no
doubt planted the germ of the future courses of Epsom
and Ascot, of which he is in our day made the mighty
patron and the ruling god<a name="FNa_1-37" id="FNa_1-37"></a><a href="#FoN_1-37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-215" id="V1-215"></a>[<a href="./images/1-215.png">215</a>]</span></p>
<p>After Nimrod the people are very fond of talking about
<i>Enoch</i>, who is called in the Koran <i>Edrees</i> (&#8238;&#1575;&#1583;&#1585;&#1610;&#1587;&#8236;).
My taleb says that he did not undergo the penalty of
nature, but was translated, as, indeed, it is recorded of
him in our sacred books. My taleb adds, "Enoch was
a tailor, and one day the devil came to him and offered
to sell him some eggs, declaring that in the eggs the
whole world was included. Enoch rejoined, '<i>Also in the</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-216" id="V1-216"></a>[<a href="./images/1-216.png">216</a>]</span>
<i>eye of my needle is the whole world comprehended</i>.'
Immediately the eggs began to expand, and although
really empty, swelled out as wide as the arms when
outstretched. Enoch seeing this was all imposition, to
punish the impostor, sewed up one of the devil's eyes,
who went off in a great rage. The needle of Enoch was
nevertheless all powerful, and the devil has gone about
with <i>one eye</i> ever since." My taleb asked me whether I
ever heard of Noah. I opened the Arabic Bible and
read some passages about the Flood. "Yes," he said,
"Seedna (<i>our lord</i>) Noah was a carpenter (&#8238;&#1606;&#1580;&#1617;&#1575;&#1585;&#8236;)
because he built the ship (&#8238;&#1575;&#1604;&#1601;&#1604;&#1603;&#8236;). I am also a carpenter.
I will show you my collection of tools. But I
don't work now at this trade, except for my amusement."
The people know many of the common trades which
they exercise occasionally as amateurs.</p>

<p>Nothing puzzles the Touaricks and Negroes so much as
my <i>gloves</i>. Am obliged to put them on and off frequently
a dozen times a day, for their especial gratification.
My Leghorn hat, on the contrary, here, as in
The Mountains, is an object of admiration, on account of
the fineness of the platting. It astonishes them how it
could be done. The large straw hats, with huge broad
brims, worn in The Desert, are all of the coarsest
texture.</p>

<p>This morning made inquiries of the Touaricks respecting
serpents in The Desert. Could obtain but little
information, the notions of the Saharan tribes in general
being very confused about serpents. All serpents go
under the name of <i>lef&acirc;ah</i> (&#8238;&#1604;&#1601;&#1593;&#1577;&#8236;). But other names are
in use here, as &#8238;&#1581;&#1606;&#1588; &#1581;&#1610;&#1577;&#8236; &amp;c., which apparently are the<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-217" id="V1-217"></a>[<a href="./images/1-217.png">217</a>]</span>
generic names. The <i>boah</i> mentioned by Dr. Russell I
have not heard of. One of the Touaricks, however,
described to me a serpent as being nearly as thick round
as a man's body, but not more than three feet in its
greatest length. This serpent has also large horns. It
is not at all dangerous. There is a much longer serpent
or snake, but not more than four inches round in thickness,
which is dangerous. If we are to believe Mr.
Jackson, the southern part of Morocco abounds with
monstrous serpents, but in all my route through The
Sahara, I met with none, nor heard of any. It is a very
old trick of the poets and retailers of the marvellous to
people The Desert with dragons, and serpents, and
monsters of every kind. We know that on the banks of
the <i>Majerdah</i> an enormous serpent stopped the progress
of the army of Regulus. Batouta, also, who flourished
in the fourteenth century, pretends that "The Desert is
full of serpents." Even Cailli&eacute;, who saw neither lions
nor elephants, or very few animals of any sort, says,
when at the wells of <i>Amoul-Gragim</i>, "My rest was
disturbed by the appearance of a serpent, five feet and
a-half long and as thick as the thigh of a boy twelve
years old. My travelling companions also experienced
similar visits." If this report be correct, it evidently
refers to the harmless <i>lef&acirc;ah</i> mentioned by the Touarick.
At the ruins of Lebida, on the coast of Tripoli, an
unusual number of large snakes were seen this year
(1845), mounting upon and twining round the broken
shafts of pillars still standing, as if at the command of
some invisible <i>jinn</i>; but they were all perfectly harmless.
The jugglers were catching them, to exhibit their forky<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-218" id="V1-218"></a>[<a href="./images/1-218.png">218</a>]</span>
tongues and snaky folds, as venomous and deadly, to the
marvel-loving crowd. The lion of The Desert is a myth.
The king of beasts never leaves his rich domain, the
thick forest and pouring cascade, where water and
animals of prey abound, for the naked, arid, sandy, and
rocky wastes of The Sahara. The ancients and moderns,
however, have persisted in representing Africa, not only
as a country full of monsters, but "<i>always producing
some new monster</i>,&mdash;"</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Semper aliquid novi Africam afferre<a name="FNa_1-38" id="FNa_1-38"></a><a href="#FoN_1-38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>,</span>
</div></div>

<p>all which is either entirely incorrect or a monstrous
exaggeration. It would have been very <i>nice</i> to fight
one's way through The Desert in the midst of every kind
of beast and monster which the gloomy imagination of
men may have conjured up from the beginning of the
annals of adventure and travel; this would have made
these pages undoubtedly very "stirring and exciting."
Happily Providence has not filled up those vast spaces
which separate Northern and Central Africa with such
hideous tenants! Sufficient are the evils of The Desert
to the wayfarer who sojourns therein.</p>

<p>In the evening, had a long conversation with a group
of people. The subjects, in which they all felt more
than ordinary curiosity, were, the new world of America,
Australia, the Pacific, and the whales in it, and the
gold and silver mines of South America, &amp;c. The number
of sheep, also, in Australia, amazed them, in comparison
with the few wandering scattered flocks in The<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-219" id="V1-219"></a>[<a href="./images/1-219.png">219</a>]</span>
Desert. I am become a walking gazette amongst the
people, and ought to be dubbed "Geographer of The
Desert." They also question me on the relative forces
of the Christian Powers, and have a great idea of the
military strength of France. The capture of Algiers
has produced a vivid and lasting impression of the French
power throughout all North Africa. They consider
England the great power on the sea, and France on the
land. I have, besides, to tell them of the population of
all the world, and to answer a thousand other questions.
Sometimes their conversation, after being exceedingly
animated, falls into unbroken and moody silence, and
they recline for hours, without moving a muscle of the
face or uttering a syllable. Indolence is the besetting
sin of the Saharan tribes. It is also the same in Tripoli.
Col. Warrington, in reporting upon the Tripolines, says:&mdash;"Whether
the extraordinary indolence of the people
proceeds from the climate, or want of occupation, I know
not, but they are in an horizontal position twenty hours
out of the twenty-four, sleeping in the open air." In
this temperate season of the year, the Ghadamsees
might find useful and healthful occupation in the gardens,
but they are so confoundedly lazy that they won't
stir, and what work really is done is performed by
slaves. Such people deserve to starve. Cailli&eacute; says:&mdash;"The
Mandingoes would rather go without food part of
the day than work in the fields; they pretend that
labour would take off their attention to the Koran,
which is a very specious excuse for laziness." Like most
people in Central Africa, all their hard work is done by
the poor slaves. The Ghadamsee people have, however,<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-220" id="V1-220"></a>[<a href="./images/1-220.png">220</a>]</span>
the excuse that, being a city of merchants, their object
is repose when they return from long journeys.</p>

Saw plenty of my acquaintances, all pleased with the

many curious facts of which have been preserved in Armenian tradition.
The Armenian Bishop, Dr. Nerses Lazar, says, for the
benefit of all England, (See his <i>Scriptural and Analogical Conversations
on the Physical and Moral World with reference to an Universal
Commercial Harmony</i>, published by Bentley, London, 1846):&mdash;"In
the second age of the world, just on entering the second
century, <i>Nimrod began to be a mighty one in the earth</i>; he was the
first great warrior, conqueror, or most severe governor. <i>He was a
mighty hunter before the Lord: wherefore it is said, Even as Nimrod
the mighty hunter before the Lord</i>, by which means he became a
mighty monarch. For he inured himself to labour by this toilsome
exercise, and got together a great company of young robust men to
attend him in this sport; <i>who were hereby also fitted to pursue men
as they had done wild beasts</i>. (Here the Free Kirk will find the
beginning of the system which they are patronizing in Yankee
Land.) Besides, in the age of Nimrod, the exercise of hunting
might win him the hearts of men, whom he thus delivered from
wild beasts, to which they were much exposed in their rude and
unprotected way of living; so that many at last joined him in the
great designs he formed of subduing men, and making himself master
of the neighbouring people in Babylon, Susiana, and Assyria.
The memory of this hunting of his was preserved by the Assyrians,
who made Nimrod the same as Orion, for they joined the dog and
the hare, the first creature perhaps that he hunted, with his constellation.
He first erected Babylon, and Assyria is called the
land of Nimrod, &amp;c., &amp;c. He began to exalt himself, and he is
called <i>Bel</i> from his dominions, and <i>Nimrod</i> from his rebellion
(against God)." The worthy prelate goes on giving a very long
affair about the father of huntsmen and jockies. Nimrod has come
up again in this our year of 1847. The French and English antiquarians
and excavators have dug him up, and all his splendid posterity
from the banks of the Euphrates at the <i>Bir-el-Nimroud</i>.
The <i>Royal Asiatic Society</i> no doubt will soon find his mark, or
cross, His Turfy Highness not being expected to be a <i>letterato</i>, in
Cuneiform, wedge-shaped or arrow-headed characters upon the
unbaked or sun-dried bricks thrown out of the famous Nineveh
mound, so that at last Nimroud will have full justice done him by
a grateful posterity.</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>28th.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Heard</span> the <i>Sh&acirc;anbah</i>&mdash;&#8238;&#1588;&#1593;&#1575;&#1606;&#1576;&#1577;&#8236;&mdash;and Touaricks
are about to have a set-to. Last year they had a skirmish,
and the Touaricks killed about eighty of the
Sh&acirc;anbah. These latter are going to avenge their defeat;
they will attack the open districts, and then proceed
to Ghat. The Sh&acirc;anbah inhabit a desert of sand
in the neighbourhood of Warklah&mdash;&#8238;&#1608;&#1575;&#1585;&#1602;&#1604;&#1577;&#8236;&mdash;about fifteen
days from Ghadames, and four from Souf. They are
independent tribes, but small in number, not more than
from five to six hundred. Nominally, however, they
are located in French Algerian territory. They have
been celebrated from time immemorial as the robbers
and assassins of The Desert&mdash;<i>to be a brigand</i> is, with
them, an hereditary honour&mdash;and they are equally the
dread of the people of Warklah, whose neighbours they
are, as of stranger merchants and caravans. They have
a well of water scooped out in the sandy regions where
their tents are pitched, and here they live in a horrid<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-222" id="V1-222"></a>[<a href="./images/1-222.png">222</a>]</span>
security, defying all law and authority, human and divine,
and all the neighbouring Powers. Around them is an
immensity of sandy wastes, and none dare pursue them to
their abhorred dens. Horses, indeed, would be useless;
and camels might wander for months without water, and
perish before coming upon their hiding places in these
dreadful regions. "Two hundred men would require
four hundred camels, eight hundred water-skins, and
provisions for two months," says the Rais, "and therefore
we must leave them to be exterminated by time."
Unfortunately, they are recruited from the bad characters
of the Souafah, a kindred tribe of Arabs, and other
outlaws. The Sh&acirc;anbah are the great professional bandits
of the North, but there are some other fragmentary
tribes, located on the confines of The Sahara, and the
valleys of the Atlas. Particularly I may mention the
horde of brigands of Wady-es-Sour, which infest the
routes between Touat and Tafilelt. But this horde is
more placable, and mostly, after levying black-mail, will
allow a caravan to pass uninterruptedly on its way.
The expedition of the Sh&acirc;anbah will take place after
Ramadan, for, like the story of the Spanish assassins,
who, being too early to enter the house of an unfortunate
victim, went in the meanwhile to the matins which
were being celebrated in a neighbouring church, so these
pious assassins of The Desert highways will not proceed
to their work of blood and slaughter until the fast of
Ramadan is concluded. The Sh&acirc;anbah and Touaricks
are, besides, national enemies as to blood, the former
being pure Arab, and the latter of the Berber, or aboriginal
stock of North Africa. The Sh&acirc;anbah have for arms
common matchlocks, and a few horses in addition to<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-223" id="V1-223"></a>[<a href="./images/1-223.png">223</a>]</span>
their camels. The Touaricks have the spear, dagger,
the straight broad sword, and a few matchlocks and
pistols, it is said, and all are mounted on camels, so
the contest is somewhat differently balanced with regard
to the mode of equipment. People speculate as to the
success of the parties, but their sympathies are entirely
with the Touaricks.</p>

<p>Said comes in blubbering, sympathizing with his countrymen,
saying, Rais has been bastinadoing his household
slaves, natives of Bornou like himself. Rais certainly
ought not to do this, for he does not bastinade
his Moors or Arab servants. In the evening I went
with Said to see the slaves of Ghadames indulge in their
native dances and other plays. These are called &#8238;&#1604;&#1593;&#1576; &#1575;&#1604;&#1593;&#1576;&#1610;&#1604;&#8236;
"<i>playing of the slaves</i>." The festival of the evening
was "<i>the night of power</i>" (&#8238;&#1604;&#1610;&#1604;&#1577; &#1575;&#1604;&#1602;&#1583;&#1585;&#8236;), on which the
Koran<a name="FNa_1-39" id="FNa_1-39"></a><a href="#FoN_1-39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> descended from heaven, and the slaves were
allowed a holiday in consideration of this solemnity.
The slaves danced in a circle around a leader of the dance
in the centre. At first, it is a simple walking round,
face to back, the legs raised, and a little swinging, and
the steps keeping time to the iron castanets fastened
on the hands of each. Meanwhile, they sing, and the
chorus comes at intervals between the noise of castanets,
or finger-clappers. They now turn round and
face their leader, some prostrating before him, and others
twirling themselves round, but always moving in their
circular motion and singing. The tones of their voice<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-224" id="V1-224"></a>[<a href="./images/1-224.png">224</a>]</span>
are melodious and deep, not the plaintive wearying
monotony of the Arabs. Now the sounds increase, the
chorus rises higher and higher, the steps fall heavy, like
the tread of military, on the ground; and now, sounds,
steps, and every noise and movement quickens, until it
becomes a frantic rush around their terrified leader, who
is at last, as the finish of the dance, overthrown in the
wild tumult.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Besides the castanets, they
have a rude drum, consisting of a piece of skin stretched
over the mouth of a large calabash, brought from Soudan,
which makes a low hollow sound: to these is added
occasionally a rude squeaking hautboy. This circular
dance was performed by about thirty male slaves, gaily
dressed in their best clothes, and evidently all very happy,
in truth, the free blood of their native homes danced
through their veins. Aye, the poor slave danced and
sung! happier far than his proud and wealthy master,
who looked on in moody silence. So God has ordained
it to alleviate and balance human miseries. This dance
of freedom lasted a full hour, and was very laborious.
There were several Negresses near, who answered in shrill
voices to the deep choruses of the Negroes, but did not
themselves dance. After the circular dance, came off
reels of couples. These were danced with great spirit,
nay, violence: there was no dancing of a person singly.
None of the dancing was indecent, like the Moorish;
the lower part of the body and legs now and then
assumed steps and positions like the well known Spanish
<i>fandango</i> with castanets.</p>

<p><i>29th.</i>&mdash;Weather is now tolerably cool all day long in
the city, but not cool enough for agreeable travelling.
Sketched to-day the <i>A&acirc;ween</i>, &#8238;&#1575;&#1593;&#1608;&#1610;&#1606;&#8236;, or square of<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-225" id="V1-225"></a>[<a href="./images/1-225.png">225</a>]</span>
"fountains," which belongs to the faction of the Ben
Weleed. A group of fifty persons surrounded me, all
clamoring to see what I was doing, and making the funniest
observations. They call drawing, <i>writing</i> a thing.
One said, "Ah, it is well written, the Christians know
everything but God." Another, "Y&acirc;kob, shall you give
that writing to your Sultan?" From the fountains in
this square, which merely run into stone troughs, the
camels drink.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill1-10.jpg"><img src="./images/ill1-10_th.jpg" alt="Square of Fountains" title="Square of Fountains" /></a></p>

<p>The white women, or the respectable women of Ghadames,
white or coloured, never descend to the streets, nor
even go into the gardens around their houses. Their flat-roofed
house is their eternal promenade, and their whole
world is comprehended within two or three miserable
rooms. The date-palms they see, and a few glimpses of
The Desert beyond&mdash;and this is all. Truly it is necessary
to establish an Anti-Slavery Society for the women
of this oasis. I have visited a few of them in their<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-226" id="V1-226"></a>[<a href="./images/1-226.png">226</a>]</span>
private apartments with their husbands, in my capacity
of quack-doctor. None of them were fair or beautiful,
but some pleasing in their manners, and of elegant
shape; they are brunettes, one and all, with occasionally
large rolling, if not fiery, black eyes. They are gentle in
their manners, and were very friendly to The Christian.
Many of them, in spite of their seclusion, shewed extreme
intelligence; they are also very industrious. My
taleb assured me the little money he got from keeping
the register of the distribution of water, and other minor
matters, could not keep his family, and his chief support
was from the industry of his wife in weaving, whom
he highly praised, adding, "God has given me the best
wife in Ghadames." Most of the women weave woollens
enough for the consumption of their family, and some for
sale abroad. The education of women consists in learning
by heart certain prayers, portions of the Koran, and
legendary traditions of the famous <i>Sunnat</i>. The women
are proud of their learning, and the men pride themselves
in saying, "Only in this country are women so
well instructed!" Besides this, they have the privilege
of going to the mosques very early in the morning, and
late in the evening, where they say their prayers like
men, at least, so I understood from my taleb; but a
Christian must not ask questions about women in these
countries. The same authority assured me, the women,
mostly negresses and half-castes, seen in the streets in
the day-time, are slaves, or esteemed as such, the
Touarick women excepted. I have no doubt the manners
of the women of this city are generally very correct,
and as chaste as any women in North Africa. But the
Touarick women, especially of the elder sort, are not<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-227" id="V1-227"></a>[<a href="./images/1-227.png">227</a>]</span>
always exceedingly refined. One morning, going out
from my house, I found some seven or eight Touarick
women sitting on the stone-bench at the door. They
began to laugh and joke with me; at last one of the
elder present said, "Now, Christian, give me some
money, and then I'll come into your house." At this
delicate sally, all expressed their approbation in loud
laughter: the half-caste women are much the same. A
Moor said something to me, which I did not understand,
and then laughed and said, "It is a Negro word," and,
lest I should want an interpreter, an half-caste lady
present, putting her hand deliberately to something, said,
"That's the meaning," repeating the action two or three
times. On the whole, however, I have not seen so many
cases of indelicacy in this part of the world, as are to
be seen almost every day in Paris and London. No,
the morals of The Desert are mostly pure and continent
as compared to those of our great European cities.</p>

<p>My taleb to-day made a vocabulary of the Touarghee,
Ghadamsee, and Arabic languages. He finished also the
translation of the third chapter of Matthew into the
Ghadamsee language, which I sent afterwards to the
British and Foreign Bible Society. I did not expect
that he would have done it so easily, thinking his religious
scruples would have interfered. He would have
done all the Gospels had I paid him. According to
Ben Mousa, the Ghadamsee language contains a few
Arabic words, and is a most ancient dialect. It is
spoken only at Siwah and Ougelah, two Tripoline oases
near the coast, ten days apart, on the route to Egypt,
and there is a dialect something like it in one of the
Tunisian mountains. Many of the Touarghee words, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-228" id="V1-228"></a>[<a href="./images/1-228.png">228</a>]</span>
says also, are very much like, if not the same, as those
of Ghadamsee. I showed him the Gospel of St. Luke,
translated into the Berber language of Algeria, through
Mr. Hodgson, and published by the Bible Society. He
was only able to recognize a few Ghadamsee words in
this translation. The Berber dialects, which comprehend
the Ghadamsee, the Touarghee, the Kabylee, the Shouweeah
(of Dr. Shaw), and the Shelouk of Morocco,
although more or less intimately related, are very dissimilar
in many words and expressions. But they are
sister branches of one original mother, which require to
be reduced to consistency and harmony by some mastermind,
and then a very copious and powerful language
might be formed. Such is said to have been the state
of the German language when Luther made his translation
of the Scriptures, by which he laid the foundation
of the present mighty language of the Germans. Their
common enemy is the Arabic, which is daily making inroads
upon them; and the probability is, instead of being
moulded into one mighty whole, they will in the course of
a few centuries be destroyed by the language of their
religion, for which the Berber tribes have a superstitious
reverence. There is a singularity about the language
of Ghadames: it has differences as spoken by the two
factions of the Weleed and the Wezeet, the provincialisms
of the country. It is highly probable that the various
Berber dialects are the fragments of the language of
those formidable, but doubtful, auxiliaries, which so often
balanced and changed the fortune of Roman and Carthaginian
arms. Of all these Numidian dialects, only one
people has amongst them a native alphabet, the rest
using Arabic characters: this people are the Touaricks.<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-229" id="V1-229"></a>[<a href="./images/1-229.png">229</a>]</span>
It is besides worthy of remark, that amongst all the
African tribes of Central Africa, nay, every part of Africa,
excepting the Coptic and Abyssinian Christians, only
one alphabet has been found, none of the other tribes
having any characters wherewith to write. Specimens
of the Touarghee and Ghadamsee language, as well as
this alphabet, have been recently published, under the
auspices of the Foreign Office.</p>

<p>The language of Ghadames is spoken by an extremely
mixed and various population. Some are from Arabs
of the plains, others from Arabs of the mountains,
others from Berber tribes, others from Moors of the
Coast, and not a few from Negress mothers, of every
description of Negro race found in the interior. Sometimes
the men make a boast of being descended from
ancestors of pure Arab blood, from immigrants of the
princes of Mecca and countries thereabouts in Arabia, but
in practice they contemn the principle of uncontaminated
blood, cohabiting with their favourite female slaves, and
from these rearing up a large family of mixed blood and
colour. In the Arab suburb a considerable number of
free Negroes, the offspring of liberated slaves, are settled.
This class of population has been mistaken for emigration
from the interior, by some writers; but Negroes
never emigrate from the south to the north over The
Desert, however, some may wander, like the Mandingoes,
in the countries of Western Africa, as itinerant
traders, tinkers, and pedlars. The city of Ghadames
presents therefore a most mixed and coloured population,
there being but very few of pure Arab blood, and fewer
still of fair complexions. I have seen, nevertheless, some
families of sandy hair and fair skins; but, certainly, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-230" id="V1-230"></a>[<a href="./images/1-230.png">230</a>]</span>
<i>barbarossa</i> ("red beard,") or flaxen locks, are not
esteemed. These children of the sun prefer the raven-black
beard, the tanned skin, and the gazelle eye. The
united population amounts to about 3,000, but there are
many Ghadamsee families established in Soudan and
Timbuctoo. I may add, six languages are spoken daily
in Ghadames, viz., Ghadamsee, Arabic, Touarghee,
Housa, Bornouse, and Timbuctoo. The Rais has not a
Turkish soldier or servant with him, or Turkish would
make seven. Mourzuk being a garrison town, there
Turkish, Greek, Italian, and Tibbo may be added to
these six languages. The Negro languages are spoken
by the slaves and free Negroes, and the merchants in
conversing with them.</p>

<p>As a specimen of flying reports, I heard yesterday
Bona was not in the hands of the French, but the Mussulmans.
With respect to <i>shamatah</i> ("fighting"), the
reports added, the French had lost 100,000 men in
battle! The eyes of all genuine Moslems are turned
anxiously westwards, and force and conquest, is everything
with them.</p>

<p><i>30th.</i>&mdash;The mornings are now very cool and delicious.
Walked on my terrace, and enjoyed the fresh air of this
autumnal spring. The palms are beautiful to look
upon, and the Desert city has the aspect of an Hesperides.
Are these the "fortunate isles" of the ancients?
A few birds twittering and chirping about, pecking the
ripe dates.</p>

<p>My taleb, backed with two or three Mussulman doctors,
charged me in the public streets with corrupting
and falsifying the text of the word of God. "This," he
said, "I have found by looking over your <span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-231" id="V1-231"></a>[<a href="./images/1-231.png">231</a>]</span>&#8238;&#1575;&#1604;&#1575;&#1606;&#1580;&#1610;&#1604;&#8236;
Elengeel (Gospel)." It is precisely the charge which we
make against the Mohammedans. But our charge is not
so much corrupting one particular revelation as falsifying
the entire books of the Jews and the Christians, of giving
them new forms, and adding to them a great number of
old Arabian fables. A taleb opened the Testament at
the Gospel of St. Mark, and read, <i>that Jesus was the Son
of God</i>. Confounded and vexed at this, he said, "<i>God
neither begets nor is begotten</i>," (a verse of the Koran).
An Arab from the Tripoline mountains turned upon
me and said, "What! do you know God?" I answered
sharply, "Yes; do you think the knowledge of God is
confined to you alone?" The bystanders applauded the
answer.</p>

<p>In general, the ignorant of the population of this
part of North Africa, as well as Southern Morocco and
Wadnoun, think the Christians are not acquainted with
God, something in the same way as I heard when at
Madrid, that Spaniards occasionally asked, if there were
Christians and churches in England: "Hay los Cristianios,
hay las iglesias in Inglaterra?" But in other
parts of Barbary, I have found, on the contrary, an
opinion very prevalent, that the religion of the English is
very much like the religion of the Moors, arising, I have
no doubt, from the absence of images and pictures in
Protestant churches.</p>

<p>This evening, when visiting the Ben Weleed, conversation
turned upon the Bas-Relief. The people showed some
jealousy at my possessing it, and would have prefered that
it remained in the oasis, and were not sent to Tripoli.
They added:&mdash;"Because it proves that God has given
us the land of the Christians." This is the grand argu<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-232" id="V1-232"></a>[<a href="./images/1-232.png">232</a>]</span>ment
in proof of the Mussulman's religion, that God has
given him the countries of the Infidels. Indeed, the
sooner the Bas-Relief is off the better. On my observing
that the slab belonged to a date prior to the
Christians, they were astonished, and asked, "<i>Who were
before the Christians?</i>" They have no idea of people
before the Christians. The conversation was suddenly
stopped by the appearance of a remarkable personage,
the <i>quasi</i>-Sultan of the Ben Weleed. This was the
famous rich and powerful Haj Ben Mousa Ettanee. He
is a man of a great age, and nearly blind, and the chief of
the most numerous and influential family of Ghadames.
He always exhibits a most difficult and obstinate temper
in public affairs, and, I understand, from the first, has
shown an hostility to my residence in Ghadames,
unlike the Sheikh Makouran, who is the recognized Chief
of the Ben Wezeet, and who has shown himself as favourable
as the other Chief hostile. There may be a little
of the spirit of faction in this; for we see often a person
unsupported by the one party, because he is supported
by the other party. But the whole family of Ettanee
is considered <i>w&acirc;r</i> ("difficult"). The Rais speaking to
me of this family, said: "W&acirc;r, w&acirc;r&mdash;I can do nothing
with the Ettanee." Ettanee was attended by two or
three servants, one carrying a skin, and another a cushion
to recline on (<i>mokhaddah</i>). These arranged, the old
gentleman mounted upon the stone-bench and took his
seat, everybody making way for him with the greatest
alacrity. Having heard I was present, after a short silence,
he addressed me: "Christian, do you know Scinde<a name="FNa_1-40" id="FNa_1-40"></a><a href="#FoN_1-40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-233" id="V1-233"></a>[<a href="./images/1-233.png">233</a>]</span>
I replied, "I know it." "Are not the English there?" he
continued. "Yes," I said. He then turned and said
something to the people in the Ghadamsee language<a name="FNa_1-41" id="FNa_1-41"></a><a href="#FoN_1-41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>.
My conversation with them was always in Arabic. He
abruptly turned to me, "Why do the English go there,
and eat up all the Mussulmans? Afterwards you will
come here." I replied, "The Ameers were foolish, and
engaged in a conspiracy against the English of India;
but the Mussulmans in Scinde enjoyed the same rights
and privileges as the English themselves." "That's what
you say," he rejoined, and then continued: "Why do
you go so far from home, to take other people's countries
from them?" I replied, "The Turks do the same; they
came here in The Desert." "Ah! you wish to be such
oppressors as the Turks," he continued very bitterly, and
then told me not to talk any more. No one present
dared to put in a word. This painful silence continued
for some time. I was anxious to get off, feeling very disagreeable;
and beginning to move, he said to somebody,
"<i>Who's</i> that?" for he couldn't see much, being nearly
blind. They told him it was the Christian going. He
cried out, "Stop!" and then added, "You have books
with you, but you English are not Christians. You deceive
us. Nor are the Danish, or the Swedes, or the Russians
Christians. <i>They have no books.</i>" He meant <i>religious</i>
books. The same opinion, I found afterwards, was entertained
by Haj Ibrahim, a very respectable and intelligent
Moorish merchant of Tripoli. Haj Ibrahim said to me,
"How is it that you have books on religion, when the<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-234" id="V1-234"></a>[<a href="./images/1-234.png">234</a>]</span>
English have none?" Formerly Ettanee resided at
Tripoli; and I have not the least doubt both these
Moors derived this false information from the intolerant
and Protestant-hating Romanist priests resident in
Tripoli, backed as the falsehoods were by the absence of
any English church or worship, although the English
Consul very regularly celebrated worship in his family
every Sunday,&mdash;a circumstance which ought to have been
known amongst the town population of all religions. I
am sorry the intentions of the British Government have
been so feebly carried out by the Bishop of Gibraltar.
Her Majesty's Government was anxious that Dr. Tomlinson
should visit all the coasts of the Mediterranean,
both to strengthen the few Protestants scattered on these
inhospitable shores, and to show the various authorities
and people of this famed inland sea, that the English
had a religion, and cared for its prosperity. Up to the
time I left the Barbary coast, Dr. Tomlinson had neither
visited Tunis nor Tripoli, though he had been resident at
Malta some three years. This is too bad; and it is
quite clear the Bishop does not understand the object of
his mission in the Mediterranean. He ought to have
shown himself at once in all Barbary; he then might
have annihilated this monstrous error, propagated by
Romish priests, that the English had no religious books,
and were not Christians. It is but justice to add, the
Bishop went to Tangiers. Mr. Hay expected a very
unctuous episcopal visit, and was shocked to hear the
good Bishop talk so much about fortifications and "horrid
war." There is consistency in everything; and common
sense dictated that the Bishop should have, on such a visit,
assumed his character of "Overseer of the scattered Pro<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-235" id="V1-235"></a>[<a href="./images/1-235.png">235</a>]</span>testant
flock." Unfortunately, when he went first to
Malta, Dr. Tomlinson acted more like an episcopalian
tight-rope dancer, always balancing himself between
Puseyism and Evangelicalism, and so distracted the few
Protestants at Malta. He is eminently a man of no
decision of character; and whenever he does manage to
get up his reluctant will to a decision, it is invariably on
the wrong side of the question. Here in The Desert I
found myself pestered with both political and religious
questions; and to have shirked either, would have been
to offend the people. There was no alternative but to
preach to them that all the English and all Protestants
had the same Bible as the Romanists, and were equally
Christians with them. I may add, of the Bishop of
Gibraltar: Since my return, I have heard that his Lordship
found all his efforts useless to conciliate the Malta
papistical authorities; that he was much shocked at their
treachery; and that he was determined, on his return
again to Malta, <i>to become once more a good Protestant</i>.
The truth is, he had nothing to do with the Roman
Catholics. He was to mind and care for the Protestants
in Malta, and on the shores of the Mediterranean. I
believe, however, he did do something in the way of
unpleasant interference with Colonel Warrington. It is
well known the Colonel was high-priest of Protestantism
through his long Consular service of thirty-three years,
as well as Her Britannic Majesty's Consul. The Colonel
baptized, married, and buried, whenever applied to. He
baptized, married, and buried the members of his own
family, and was surprised Sir Thomas Reade had not the
courage to do the same. Of this the Colonel was very
proud, citing the authority of some peer in the British<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-236" id="V1-236"></a>[<a href="./images/1-236.png">236</a>]</span>
Parliament, who said, "If the King's subjects wished to
<i>procreate</i> in a foreign land, where there was no parson,
why should not the British Consul help them?" This
the Bishop demurred at; but the Colonel supported himself
on the authority of Dr. Lushington. The Colonel
was undoubtedly right. Still, politically and ecclesiastically,
it would be much better if English clergymen of
some denomination or other were established along the
line of the whole coast of North Africa, which would
show the native Mussulmans we had a religion, and that
we could afford to support and protect our co-religionists.
The French reap a good harvest by <i>their protection of
Christians</i>, which, characteristically enough, they use as
a political engine of aggrandizement.</p>

<p>On returning home, my Moorish friends pestered me
still with more questions, as to what people were <i>before</i>
the Christians. I endeavoured to impress upon them,
that the Christian era was comparatively <i>new</i>, and that
<i>before</i> Christ, there were many nations, and great events
occurred. I found them grossly ignorant. But I had
the good fortune to procure an Arabic map in the possession
of one of the merchants, who had laid it up for
many years amongst dusty papers. This had been published
by the printers and agents of the Church Missionary
Society of Malta, very much to their credit. By the
aid of this, I made more progress in teaching geography
to the people. Seeing several dots on the map where
<i>Sahara</i> is written, the people asked me what it meant.
I told them sand. However, I must protest against this
device. We shall see that the greater part of The Desert
is stone and hard earth. The term "<i>sandy border</i>" of
The Desert is equally incorrect. Such a distinction does<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-237" id="V1-237"></a>[<a href="./images/1-237.png">237</a>]</span>
not exist in the Tripoline provinces. The Desert comes
up to the gates of Tripoli, it then gives way to cultivation
and The Mountains; it beyond them appears again
here and there and everywhere, within and without the
regions of rain. There is nothing like a border of The
Desert. The "Grand Desert" and "Petite Desert" of
the French, are equally incorrect and absurd. All is
Sahara, or waste, uncultivated lands, and oases scattered
thick within them, as spots on the back of the
leopard<a name="FNa_1-42" id="FNa_1-42"></a><a href="#FoN_1-42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>.</p>

<p>Saw the Rais late, who had heard all about my conversation
with Ettanee, and jokingly said, "<i>W&acirc;r, w&acirc;r</i>,
that old fellow, aye?" His Excellency turned, to other
matters: "The Sh&acirc;nbah are not going to attack the
Touaricks, they are coming hereabouts to plunder our
caravans." Asked him, if the city was secure enough
to prevent them entering and pillaging it? His Excellency
replied, "Yes," but adding, "<i>koul sheyan maktoub</i>
(all is predestinated)." This doctrine is not only a comfort
in every misfortune, but also an apology for every
fault, crime, or mismanagement a person may be guilty
of. Nay, if a man be starved to death, because he will
not work, which is sometimes the case in this part of the
world, as well as Ireland, it is destiny and the will of
God! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. So of all other things. If Ghadames
should be stormed and plundered by the Sh&acirc;nbah in its
present defenceless condition, it will be, as a matter of
course, the will of God. But I must add, which unhap<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-238" id="V1-238"></a>[<a href="./images/1-238.png">238</a>]</span>pily
cannot be said of Ireland, the security of human
life is very great in Ghadames and the neighbouring
desert. I have heard of no murder since I have been
here, and a murder is the last thing thought of. This
does not arise from any preventitive police, but from the
simple dispositions of the people&mdash;their horror and
unwillingness to shed human blood! If a messenger
from a distant planet were to come to prove the divinity
of a religion, from the absence of the crime of murder,
and were to take these Saharan oases, and our Ireland,
and put them in the balances of Eternal Justice, we
should soon see Ireland and its popular religion kick the
the beam, as&mdash;</p>

<p>The "signs of the times" in this country are, when I
first came here bread was found in the Souk occasionally,
as a luxury for the poor who could not buy wheat and
make bread; now, and it is only a little more than a
month, no bread is to be found. To-day not a single
sheep was killed anywhere, and I am obliged to go without
meat. So the country progresses in poverty and
misery, so rapidly is its money being filched from the
people! Or, is it because every body has conspired
together against the Rais, and determined to wear an
air of abject poverty? And thus to evade the new contributions?
This cannot be. To-morrow is the last day
of Ramadan; provided the new moon can be seen. I
hope they'll see it, for I am heartily sick of the
Ramadan: the most amiable and kind-hearted get out
of humour in Ramadan; as to the Rais, I never go to<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-239" id="V1-239"></a>[<a href="./images/1-239.png">239</a>]</span>
see him, except in the evening, unless to get a little
money from him, his Excellency being my banker. A
Turk, who smokes all day long for eleven months out of
twelve, must suffer greatly in these thirty days. Should
like to have tried a day's fasting, as I have been so
strongly recommended by the people, but I expect to have
enough of fasting in The Desert, and it is of no use
adding to our miseries for the sake of curiosity or vanity.
From recent conversations, it appears there is no great
danger in attempting Timbuctoo, but I have resolved on
the route of Kanou, because my object is not so much a
journey of discovery, as to collect a statistical account of
the slave-trade, and see whether there are any practicable
legitimate means for extinguishing the odious traffic.
For this latter object, the Kanou route is decidedly
more advantageous. A wild adventure to Timbuctoo,
ever so successful, can never serve me in such stead in
the end, when I have to read my own heart and its
motives, as a humane mission on the behalf of unhappy
weak Africans, doomed, by men calling themselves
Christians, to the curse of slavery.</p>

<p><i>1st October.</i>&mdash;Sheikh Makouran paid me a visit this
morning. Our conversation turned chiefly on the discoveries
of lands and countries since the times of Christ
and Mahomet. The Sheikh was a little surprised when
I told him: "We ought to consider the world as just
beginning, for the ancients knew but little, and the
greater part of the now inhabited world was unknown to
them." Moors, like some Christians, think the time is
near when Deity shall appear to destroy all unbelievers
in their respective religions. For myself, I cannot but
believe that the world has only <i>yet</i> begun. It is impos<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-240" id="V1-240"></a>[<a href="./images/1-240.png">240</a>]</span>sible
that the Creator should destroy the world in its
present imperfect state. No&mdash;the world will go on yet
thousands of years on years in the path of improvement
unto (<i>shall I say?</i>) perfection. At any rate, I belong to
those whose aspirations are for the future and not for
the past. I am not enamoured with Hebrew patriarchal
innocence, or Grecian classic polish and freedom, or
Christian medi&aelig;val chivalry of the past. I am of the
<i>New</i> Englanders, but not for the resurrection of the past.
Rather than subscribe to divinely-anointed kings and
pious monks, church charities and May-day holidays
and May-poles for the people, I would sooner affix my
signature to railways, electric telegraphs, and the wild,
bold, and raving aspirations of a Shelley&mdash;in fact, to
plunge anywhere head <i>foremost</i>, than back again into
the past.</p>

<p>A Moor to-day, in wishing to give a grand idea of the
Touaricks (some of whom were present), said, "Muley
Abd Errahman (Emperor of Morocco) and the Sultan
of Stamboul, pay tribute to the Touaricks; but they pay
tribute to no one." This is ingeniously made out by the
merchants of Tripoli and Morocco, the subjects of the
two Sultans, being obliged to pay black-mail in passing
through the Saharan districts of the Touaricks. Some
of the ill-natured are continually magnifying the dangers
of the route of Kanou, and one present said, "You
can't go, there are thousands of Touaricks to block up
your way." Annoyed with this man and others, I
replied, "Do Touaricks eat the flesh of Christians after
they have killed them?" This made him very angry,
and he began to apologize for the Touaricks, one class of
Mohammedans being always anxious to defend another<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-241" id="V1-241"></a>[<a href="./images/1-241.png">241</a>]</span>
from unwonted or odious suspicions. They have, nevertheless,
not the least difficulty in confessing that the
Touaricks will kill Christians, as such, thus tacitly
acknowledging it to be right to kill Christians. The
more respectable Ghadamseeah argue that in no case, if
I pay the Touaricks a certain sum as tribute, or what
not, have the Touaricks a right by the law of the Prophet
to do me the least harm. Heard all the Arab
soldiers have run away from Emjessen, being without
anything to eat. These wise Turkish commanders gave
the poor fellows a bag of barley and a little oil, and
left it, like the widow's cruse in Holy Writ, to replenish
itself. The Sh&acirc;nbah may now go and drink the water
of the well, and plunder the caravans as they please.
The wonder is that more open-desert robberies are not
committed.</p>

<p>The Rais told me this evening that <i>one</i> person saw the
moon, but it is necessary <i>two</i> should have seen the dim,
pale, half-invisible crescent streak. Then the <i>&acirc;yed</i> after
the fast would have been to-morrow. At sun-set, all the
people were on the <i>qui-vive</i>, the Marabouts mounting
the minaret tops, but none saw it but this solitary moongazer,
who, said the Rais, "might have <i>imagined</i> he saw
the moon." The telescope was not lawful, he added,
"The people must see it with the naked, unassisted
eye."</p>

<p><i>2nd.</i>&mdash;No patients; only a little girl with severe
ophthalmia, and the old blind man, who fancies his
eyes are better with the application of the caustic.
Generally the Moors think there is a different sort of
medicine for women. Yesterday I was asked for a
medicine for women. I gave a man a fever powder for<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-242" id="V1-242"></a>[<a href="./images/1-242.png">242</a>]</span>
his wife. This morning being the last before the Ramadan,
the Rais sent me a <i>backsheesh</i> of meat (not cooked) and a
quantity of rice, enough to make a sumptuous festa.
Certainly the Rais is very gracious, and continues, if
not increases, in his friendly feelings towards me. People
are killing and preparing for the festival. There's a
report, the merchants in Tripoli are afraid to leave
for this city on account of rumoured depredations <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: 'of' added to text">of</ins> the
Seb&acirc;ah and Sh&acirc;nbah. To-morrow, my taleb says he
marries his two daughters. He prepares the wedding-feast,
and gives his daughters a stock of <i>semen</i> (liquid
butter), and barley and wheat, to begin the world with.
The sons-in-law make presents to their brides of clothes,
besides a little money; and this is all the matter. My
taleb seems very glad to get rid of his daughters so
easily; they are extremely young&mdash;thirteen and fifteen.
Besides these daughters he has a pet son. People
usually choose a religious festival, for the day of the
celebration of their nuptials, as in some parts of England.
The taleb then, who is excessively fond of religious
discussion, began, "The essence of all religion is,&mdash;</p>

<p class="figcenter">&#8238;&#1608;&#1607;&#1608; &#1604;&#1575; &#1610;&#1608;&#1604;&#1583; &#1608;&#1604;&#1575; &#1605;&#1608;&#1604;&#1583;&#8236;</p>

<p class="figcenter"><i>God has no associate</i>":&mdash;</p>

<p>both referring to the unity of God. Speaking of the
duration of the world, I said:&mdash;"The world must now
begin, for, up to this time, men have been generally very
ignorant; and until lately the whole of the earth has not
been discovered." Very angry at this, he replied:&mdash;"Now
the world will finish; God is coming to destroy<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-243" id="V1-243"></a>[<a href="./images/1-243.png">243</a>]</span>
all you Christians, and all the black <i>kafers</i> (infidels), as
well as the white." He then gave me an account of the
creation. "The world," he said, "was created seven
times," &amp;c., &amp;c., adding many curious things.</p>

<p><i>I.</i>&mdash;"What is to become of the world; are nearly all
its inhabitants, from its beginning until now, to be
d&mdash;&mdash;d?"</p>

<p><i>He.</i>&mdash;"Yes."</p>

<p><i>I.</i>&mdash;"Is this the decree of God?"</p>

<p><i>He.</i>&mdash;"Yes, all is <i>maktoub</i>."</p>

<p><i>I.</i>&mdash;"But you say, God, is &#8238;&#1575;&#1604;&#1585;&#1581;&#1605;&#1575;&#1606; &#1575;&#1604;&#1585;&#1581;&#1610;&#1605;&#8236;, (<i>Most
merciful</i>.)"</p>

<p><i>He.</i>&mdash;"Yes; but men won't obey his religion and
Mahomet."</p>

<p><i>I.</i>&mdash;"What is to become of those who never saw, nor
never could see or read the Koran?"</p>

<p><i>The Taleb.</i>&mdash;"I don't know; God is great; God must
have mercy upon them."</p>

<p><i>I.</i>&mdash;"Undoubtedly God created the world; but according
to you, the world is now all corrupt (<i>fesad</i>), and
nearly all men must soon be destroyed. Is this honourable
to God?"</p>

<p><i>The Taleb.</i>&mdash;"All is decreed."</p>

<p><i>I.</i>&mdash;"But many of the unbelieving Infidels are better
than the Touaricks and Arabs. Is not the British Consul
in Tripoli better than a Sh&acirc;nbah bandit?&mdash;better
than an assassin who cuts the throats of the Faithful?
Do not all the people speak well of our Consul?"</p>

<p><i>The Taleb.</i>&mdash;"I know it; he's very good."</p>

<p><i>I.</i>&mdash;"But you can't change the religion of some people
though you kill them. When the Mohammedans conquered
India, they got tired of putting Hindoos to death<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-244" id="V1-244"></a>[<a href="./images/1-244.png">244</a>]</span>
for not changing their religion, and becoming Mussulmans."</p>

<p><i>The Taleb.</i>&mdash;"God knows all, but you don't know," (a
frequent phrase in the Koran).</p>

<p><i>I.</i>&mdash;"Now, I don't think it's of much use to talk
about religion, for you won't change yours nor I mine.
Here's the end of the matter. We must all die, that's a
thing no one disputes; but as to who is saved, or who
perishes, we cannot tell."</p>

<p><i>The Taleb.</i>&mdash;"The truth, by G&mdash;d! If God please,
we shall see all soon."</p>

<p>A small caravan of Arabs, bringing sheep for the
<i>Ayed</i>, arrived this morning from Tunis. The route is
<i>vi&acirc;</i> Jibel Douerat, and only seven days. If the roads
were safe, travelling indeed about North Africa could
soon be rendered expeditious. The Arabs report:&mdash;"That
great military preparations are making at Jerbah,
where the Bey of Tunis is expected after the <i>Ayed</i>, and
whence he will invade Tripoli, all his Arabs being ready
to march with him." After this, a caravan of forty
slaves arrived from the south, under the conduct of
Touaricks. The <i>ghafalah</i> is originally from Bornou, but
half left for Fezzan on arriving at Ghat. Was much
surprised when Rais told me this evening, after five or six
days, he would send a soldier to sleep as a guard in my
house. He explained he had received authentic intelligence
from Souf, of the Sh&acirc;nbah banditti being on the
march, five hundred strong, proceeding in the direction
of Ghat and Ghadames, and he expected them near this
in the course of ten days. Their <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'intentions'">intention</ins> is to avenge
themselves on the Touaricks for the defeat last year.
They are the immemorial enemies of the Touaricks, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-245" id="V1-245"></a>[<a href="./images/1-245.png">245</a>]</span>
have a stake in the commerce of the Desert, but they as
professional robbers have none. Besides this, we hear
the Seb&acirc;ah continue their depredations, and have carried
off 2,000 sheep from The Mountains: they also threaten
an attack on Derge. The whole country, indeed, will
soon be full of banditti, unless some energetic measures
are adopted, and we shall have no communication between
this and Tripoli. All the routes are now considered
unsafe. Rais assured me, he has applied to the
Pasha for a few Turkish troops, but His Highness refused,
on the plea of expense. The whole force of the Rais is
not a hundred Arabs, and poor miserable fellows they
are, with two or three horses placed at their disposal.
With such inconsiderable means the Pacha presumes to
hold in the heart of The Desert this important commercial
city, and its dependencies of Seenawan and Derge!
The French manage matters very differently in Algeira.
Indeed, the united force occupying all Tripoli, with its
wide-spread provinces of many hundred miles apart,
does not exceed <i>five</i> thousand men of all arms! Compare
this to the hundred and thirty thousand men (including
native troops) in Algeira, and be astonished at
the different effects of the French and Turkish systems.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. To
add to the Rais's embarrassments, the
people are in ill-humour, whilst some hear the news with
pleasure, and fancy they see in our present troubles the
beginning of the end of Turkish rule in Ghadames.</p>

<p><i>3rd.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">The</span> Ayed &#8238;&#1593;&#1610;&#1583;&#8236;, succeeding Ramadan, is ushered
in with a cold morning, the first cold morning I have felt
in The Desert. Might venture to put on my cloth
pantaloons. Happy to feel this invigorating cold. This
is the little &acirc;yed; the &acirc;yed kebir, or &acirc;yed Seedna
Ibrahim, takes place two months hence, when every
family, in imitation of Abraham offering up his son
Isaac, kills or sacrifices a lamb. The caravan from
Bornou reports the road to be good. It is added, rain
has fallen in Ghat as well as in The Sahara, near Tunis
and Tripoli, so that the oasis of Ghadames is the only
dry spot, for no rain has yet fallen.</p>

<p>Had several visits from persons all dressed out in<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-247" id="V1-247"></a>[<a href="./images/1-247.png">247</a>]</span>
festival finery, amongst the rest the black dervish. He
looked like a dusky Nigritian Sultan. Twenty paras he
condescended to take from me, which added to his
holiday happiness; sometimes he won't accept of money.
Now comes Ben Mousa, my taleb, to pay his respects.
Not, as amongst the great unwashed of London, do they
shave for a penny and give a glass of &mdash;&mdash; (I shall not
say what), in the bargain, here in Ghadames they shave
for nothing. "How is this," I said to my turjeman who
had now come in. "This is the custom of the country,"
he replied, "we always shave one another for friendship."
There are several other little things done <i>gratuitously</i> in
Ghadames, but shaving the head is the principal one<a name="FNa_1-43" id="FNa_1-43"></a><a href="#FoN_1-43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>.
He who has the sharpest razor is expected to do the
most work. They cut and hack one another about most
barbarously, some using no soap, only rubbing a little
water over their heads. I have seen a score in a row, all
sitting on the ground, waiting patiently their turn. Some
shave the head every month, others allow several months
to elapse. By way of diverting conversation, my taleb
had the extreme kindness to tell me that the Touaricks
of Aheer and Aghadez (not those of Ghat) killed
Christians and Jews on the principle of religion, and
would refuse to compound matters, even if I gave them a
thousand dollars. He, however, condescended to add,
"They are <i>mahboul</i> (foolish)." He then went on to
boast of the sanctity of this city, and said, "Our people<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-248" id="V1-248"></a>[<a href="./images/1-248.png">248</a>]</span>
are not afraid of the Seb&acirc;ah and Sh&acirc;nbah, because they
are a city of marabouts." The taleb had just come from
a full divan of the people, where the Rais, on this festival
morning, had been haranguing them and flattering their
prejudices. "Be assured," said the Governor, "if the
Bashaw knew that you were a holy city, <i>a city of
dervishes</i>, a zaweea (or sanctuary), he would write to the
Sultan at Constantinople, and the Sultan, hearing of this,
would immediately give orders that no 6,000 mahboubs
were to be exacted from you, but that, on the contrary,
money from the Sultan would be sent to you, holy
people." I wondered that a man of the Rais's sense
could so commit himself. What would he have done if
after the &acirc;yed, the people had brought a petition to him,
addressed to the Sultan, setting forth that they were "<i>a
city of marabouts</i>," and praying to have their tribute
remitted? But the poor people are incapable of taking
such an advantage. They were excited by their religious
feelings, and believed all the Rais told them. It was
certainly a fine compliment for the feast, to men in the
situation of the people of Ghadames. And my informant
added: "Ahmed Effendi in The Mountains is
the rascal and the infidel, and does not tell the Pasha
we are a nation of dervishes." Said told me a slave was
brought up to day to be bastinadoed, but reprieved till
to-morrow on account of the feast. Said's sympathy is
always excited on these occasions, he remembers ancient
days. On asking what he had done, he said, "The slave
stole some dates because he had nothing to eat." My
taleb, occasionally rather free in tongue, took upon himself
to call all Negroes <i>thieves</i>. I admonished him: "The
poor slaves got little from this city of dervishes, now and<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-249" id="V1-249"></a>[<a href="./images/1-249.png">249</a>]</span>
then a little barley-meal, or lived almost altogether on a
few dates. It was not surprising they stole to satisfy
the cravings of hunger." Berka the liberated slave of
Makouran, and Said's intimate friend, now came in,
dressed up in his holiday clothes. He asked for Said.
"He is gone to The Desert, run away, for he has broken
our cooking-pot; see here are the pieces, here's the meat
spoilt; what am I to do for dinner?" I added, "He
ought to have a good beating." The poor old negro
stared and looked really grieved. At last he muttered,
"Why, Christian, that <i>breaking</i> comes from God, and
not Said." "The truth," said the taleb laughing. Said
now came in, having borrowed another pot, and Berka
was comforted at the return of his friend. In The
Desert, every accident of life is ascribed to an ever-present
and all-superintending Divinity!</p>

<p>All people enjoy their festival or carnival, to-day.
They follow the reckoning of Tripoli, but as the people
saw the moon a day sooner there, a day of fasting is
here saved. It is so fortunate not to see the moon too
soon. The appointed Ramadan is twenty-nine or thirty
days; ours is twenty-nine. However, rigid Moslems did
not begin to eat to-day till noon, after the morning prayers,
so delicately scrupulous are they. My taleb agrees with me,
that the Arabs, who usually only eat in the evening, and
don't smoke, experience but little inconvenience from the
fast. Nothing particular took place to-day's &acirc;yed, except
every one being dressed in his best clothes, and most of the
youth having on something <i>new</i>. It is the same with the
Jews of Mogador on the feast of Passover. The Sanctuaries
hoist the holy colours of their religion, beautiful
vermilion, and yellow, and green; these are their holiest<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-250" id="V1-250"></a>[<a href="./images/1-250.png">250</a>]</span>
and most-loved colours. The slaves danced and sang all
day long. I was present during the closing scene at night,
which was curious. After their continuous and laborious
dancing, they all suddenly stopped as if struck with
paralysis, offered a prayer to Allah, and dispersed. Did
not go out till evening, for if I had gone out at all in the
day-time I must have dressed up, and I did not wish to
appear a Guy Fawkes amongst the people, or excite
their curiosity or prejudices on the day of a solemn
festival. The Rais asked why I did not come in the
morning, for this was a grand receiving-day, when all
his particular friends and the heads of the people paid
him visits. On telling him, he approved my reason,
and said, "You, Y&acirc;cob, have <i>compass yaiser</i> (plenty of
wit)."</p>

<p><i>4th.</i>&mdash;To-day is half a feast, and full-grown men and
aged men are amusing themselves with swinging, like
so many boys. A dead aoudad was brought in from
The Sahara, which the Touaricks had killed. These
Touaricks are also bearers of a letter, written at Timbuctoo,
which has come the round-about way of Soudan,
announcing that the Sultan of Timbuctoo is dead. Sidi
Mokhtar, a marabout, is appointed Governor of Timbuctoo
by the new Sultan. The Sultan himself, after
visiting Timbuctoo and making this appointment, retired
to Jinnee, his royal residence. Sheikh El-Mokhtar has
a good reputation; he is now occupied reorganizing his
government. No other news. Met in the streets one of
the Touaricks who came yesterday with fifteen camel-loads
of senna. Asked him if Touaricks killed Christians.
Surprised at this abrupt question, he asked,
"<i>Why?</i>" I added, "If you are a good fellow I will go<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-251" id="V1-251"></a>[<a href="./images/1-251.png">251</a>]</span>
with you to Ghat." Pleased at this confidence, he came
home with me and took some coffee. A camel-load of
senna now sells for seventeen mahboubs. He asked me
what the Christians did with the senna, and would not
believe it was all used for physic. Said Christians were
not numerous enough to drink all they bought. There
is a wady near Ghat covered with senna, during rain,
but the greater portion of senna is brought from Aheer.</p>

<p>An instance of the way in which the Arabic language
is used, and which makes some people think there are
different dialects in this language, may be given in the
terms denoting <i>Garden</i>. For garden, the Touaricks and
people of Touat use &#8238;&#1580;&#1606;&#1617;&#1577;&#8236;, a word which frequently occurs
in the Koran, conveying the highest and purest idea of
garden, and which we usually translate "<i>paradise</i>." In
Ghadamsee and Touarghee a corruption of this pure
Arabic word is used for heaven, &#8238;&#1575;&#1580;&#1617;&#1606;&#8236;. The Tripoline
and Tunisian Moors use the term &#8238;&#1587;&#1575;&#1606;&#1610;&#1577;&#8236;, and the people
here &#8238;&#1602;&#1575;&#1576;&#1577;&#8236;, for garden, but which is, rather, kitchen-garden.
Now, all these words are good Arabic, and
may be used indifferently, at least the two latter. In
the New Testament translation, the Persian &#8238;&#1576;&#1587;&#1578;&#1575;&#1606;&#8236; is
used, which I imagine is the Eastern term for garden
generally, in opposition to the western &#8238;&#1587;&#1575;&#1606;&#1610;&#1577;&#8236;. <i>The
Garden</i> in North Africa is very different from our ideas
of a garden. Corn-fields, overshadowed with the palm,
the olive, and a few other fruit-trees, is the species of
plantation to which the term is usually applied. Certainly
a few flowers are sometimes cultivated in these gardens
of Africa, but this is the exception to the usage.</p>

<p>The Rais, who is a grave Turk, nevertheless unbended<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-252" id="V1-252"></a>[<a href="./images/1-252.png">252</a>]</span>
himself to-day, amusing himself in seeing the boys swing.
The Moors sadly wanted me to join their swinging, but
I politely declined. They said, it was "<i>medicine</i>,"
meaning good for the health, everything conducive to
health being called "<i>medicine</i>" by people in The Desert.
Was gratified to see some sports amongst the people, for
the men are always gloomy and reclining about the
streets, brooding over their ruinous affairs, and the boys
are little encouraged to healthful and innocent games.
Up to this time, the only persons I have seen happy are
the slaves, who dance and sing, and forget everything
but the present moment. The swings are tied high up
to the tallest date-palms, two or three persons swing
together, and the sport is a little dangerous. Saw no
other amusements during the &acirc;yed, except here and
there drafts, played in the primitive way of making
small holes in the sand for the squares.</p>

<p>During the expedition of the Duke d'Aumale to the
south of Algeria, the Bey of Biskera, Mohammed-es-Sagheer
("little") murdered the small garrison of soldiers
left behind, emptied the chest of what francs were in it,
and went off to The Desert. He is now living tranquilly
in the Jereed. The French made a demand to the Bey
of Tunis to have him given up, but it seems His Highness
had courage enough to resist it, alleging that he was a
political refugee. Mohammed-es-Sagheer had married a
French woman, and she ran away, or was taken by force,
with him. She had borne him two children. The most
extraordinary stories are current of this French woman.
Though a low woman of one of the towns, she gives herself
out as "the daughter of the Sultan of France!"
She rides like a man, dresses like a man, smokes, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-253" id="V1-253"></a>[<a href="./images/1-253.png">253</a>]</span>
follows the Arabs in all their expeditions <i>against</i> the
French. She has adopted the Mahometan religion, and
is become a sort of priestess, or Maraboutah. She promises
the credulous Arabs that she will not only put her
husband on the throne of Algeria, but even of France
itself, and then all the world will become Mussulmans!
The Moors say she can never leave The Desert because
she has brought her husband two children.</p>

<p>Saw Rais in the evening, and had a sort of confidential
conversation with him, and told him for the <i>first</i>
time of my intention to proceed further in the interior.
Of course, he had heard of it before from his servants.
Nevertheless, he affected great surprise and sorrow.
But, when I told him I might return in six months
hence, he became more calm. He then persuaded me
by all means to avoid the routes of the Touaricks, and
proceed to Fezzan, thence to Bornou. Speaking of the
Ghadamsee merchants and their friends and correspondents,
Messrs. Silva, Labe, Shaloum, and Francovich, in
Tripoli, he said, "Your merchants exchange products
with the Ghadamseeah in the way of barter, and make
a great deal of money, whilst the Ghadamseeah have no
money left, none at all." He wondered, like the Touaricks,
what the Christians do with all the senna. He
expected the Sh&acirc;nbah, on the route of Ghat, in a few
days' time. I observed, "People are all superbly dressed,
and there was not much appearance of poverty."
He smiled, and said, "The people are <i>sheytan</i> (very
cunning), they lay up their new clothes, and only wear
them on festivals." Speaking of slaves, his Excellency
said, "There is now no profit on slaves. Government
takes ten mahboubs duty on each. A good slave fetches<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-254" id="V1-254"></a>[<a href="./images/1-254.png">254</a>]</span>
40,000 wad&acirc; (cowries) in Soudan, usual price 30,000,
and some as low as 15,000. A good slave sells in
Ghadames for forty mahboubs." The Rais told me to
take care of the vermin, and abused the filthiness of the
people. If I escape the Touaricks and the fevers as well
as I escape the vermin, which abound on the clothes of
all the people without exception, I shall consider myself
fortunate. The inhabitants of Ghadames make no scruple
in attacking the enemy in the public streets, which stick
to them closer than their dearest friends. I attribute
my escape to my being an infidel, for their orthodox
l-i-c-e won't have anything to do with Kafers.</p>

<p>People look worse than during the Ramadan. Poor
creatures, they have little to eat; they say they have
nothing but barley-meal and dates to eat, for the Turks
have taken away all their money. Some, however, as a
luxury, which their relations and friends send them from
Soudan, masticate <i>ghour</i><a name="FNa_1-44" id="FNa_1-44"></a><a href="#FoN_1-44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>-nuts, and which I believe is the
<i>kolat</i>, or colat-nut of Cailli&eacute;. The Arabs called these
nuts the "<i>Coffee of Soudan</i>." Konja is a great place
for the growth of the ghour, two or three months west
of Kanou.</p>

<p><i>5th.</i>&mdash;Weather gets colder every day. I was reflecting
on the best situation for a Consul in Northern Sahara.
The point would be Touat, the nucleus of many routes,
the great highways of commerce in The Desert. From
this point a British Consul could keep a sharp look-out
on the French, moving southward.</p>

<p>A Mussulman doctor told me with great solemnity
this morning, that five hundred years were necessary to<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-255" id="V1-255"></a>[<a href="./images/1-255.png">255</a>]</span>
go round the world. Two hundred years desert (&#8238;&#1603;&#1624;&#1604;&#1593;&#8236;),
or nothing, or containing&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"(God's) <i>dark materials to create more worlds</i>."</span>
</div></div>

<p>Two hundred years of seas. Eighty years of Gog and
Magog. Eighteen years of Soudan. And two years <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: 'of' added to text">of</ins>
white people, including Christians and Mohammedans.
There were countries full of Mussulmans which had not
been visited by the Mussulmans of Turkey or Africa.
They had been visited by one man only, Alexander the
Great. Certainly the Moors read history <i>backwards</i>.
On asking where this information was to be obtained, he
said, "From the <i>T&#259;fseer</i> (Commentaries) of the Koran."</p>

<p>The Touaricks who have just arrived are men of very
large stature, and as "straight as a dart." Several of
them are full six feet high. Such men are alone produced
in the Sahara! All the weak and the diseased
soon die off, leaving behind only the robust. They walk
about the streets with an air of consummate pride, with
their huge broad swords swung at the back, and their
lances in their hands, like "a tall pine."</p>

<p>An Arab, just arrived from Derge, brings intelligence
that the Ghadamsee people who were in Tunis are
returning home <i>vi&acirc;</i> Tripoli. These are mostly poor
labourers, who go a few months to Tunis to amass a little
capital, with which to trade afterwards. The Ghadamsee
is constantly going on these journeys of profit and enterprize,
either as merchant or labourer. His Desert home
is the pulse of all his distant enterprises, whither he
retires to end his days, dedicating the last hours of his
existence to God. The Arab came from Derge, mounted
on a good horse, in the short time of <i>thirteen hours</i>,&mdash;by<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-256" id="V1-256"></a>[<a href="./images/1-256.png">256</a>]</span>
camels it occupies two and two-and-a-half days! The
Arab told me he killed, a few days ago, six ostriches
near Derge. The oases of <i>Derge</i> consist of four little
oases, or districts, viz., Derge (proper), Terghuddah,
Madress, and Fiffelt, containing an Arab population of
400 souls, a hardy and brave people. Water is plentiful,
but there are no hot springs. A native told me, that
invariably any stranger drinking this water, was attacked
with fever. Generally these little oases are very unhealthy.
Some assert that all who visit the oases are
taken ill. Probably, like Mourzuk, they lay low, in a wady
or hollowed plain. Date-trees are numerous, and bear
good fruit. A fair quantity of wheat and ghusub is
grown. Besides sheep, and goats, and fowls, there is a
few camels. The people are occupied in the gardens,
but too numerous for the oases; they are very poor,
and obliged to emigrate. Derge is in the more eastern
route of Zantan and Rujban; and when that of Seenawan,
the western, is not safe, this, the longer route, is
taken.</p>

<p><i>6th.</i>&mdash;Slept badly during the night; restless about my
journey. Determined now to take the Fezzan route.
Weather very soft, with murky clouds.</p>

<p>Relating to my taleb, that, formerly, Mussulmans conquered
Christians, but now, all the countries of the Mediterranean
were fast falling back again into the hands of
the Christians&mdash;such being the will of God, he consoled
himself by replying: "That, in less than forty years
will rise up one Abou Abdullah Mohammed El-Arbee
El-Korashee El-Fatamee, (&#8238;&#1575;&#1576;&#1608; &#1593;&#1576;&#1583; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607; &#1605;&#1581;&#1605;&#1617;&#1583; &#1575;&#1604;&#1602;&#1585;&#1588;&#1610; &#1575;&#1604;&#1601;&#1575;&#1591;&#1605;&#1610;&#8236;,)
who will kill all the Christians, both of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-257" id="V1-257"></a>[<a href="./images/1-257.png">257</a>]</span>
new<a name="FNa_1-45" id="FNa_1-45"></a><a href="#FoN_1-45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> and the old world; that this will be the golden
age; all people will be Mussulmans, and all will be rich
and powerful, enjoying the abundance of this world's
good things; and the very dust of the earth, and the
sand of the Sahara, will be turned into gold and silver:
But, (the awful but!) that this will only last one generation,
or <i>forty</i> years; for then will arise The Dajal! who,
mounting upon an ass, will scour the earth in three days,
and kill and destroy all the Mussulmans, this Dajal being
the Messiah of the Jews, who will all flock to his standard;
and that then will appear Jesus, <i>the Son of Mary</i><a name="FNa_1-46" id="FNa_1-46"></a><a href="#FoN_1-46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>,
from the top of the mountains of the moon, after Dajal
has reigned forty years, and slay this monster Messiah of
the Jews. Now there will appear Gog and Magog, let
loose from Jibel Kaf, in Khoristan, and the country of
the Turks and Russians. And last of all will come the
end, when the Wahabites will carry all the Jews into
hell-fire on their backs." Such are the secret consolations
of a good and orthodox Mussulman of The Sahara. A
part of this monstrous fable has been related before, with
some variations. The gist of the prophecy is, <i>the destruction
of the Christians by another Arab Conqueror</i>. Here
the now humbled follower of the Prophet finds his sweet
revenge. The same revenge the more ignorant and fanatic
of the Jews seek and cherish in the advent of their
long-expected Messiah, who is to enable them to put
their feet upon the necks of all people&mdash;all the nations<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-258" id="V1-258"></a>[<a href="./images/1-258.png">258</a>]</span>
of the earth. But the better class of Israelites are willing
to believe that the Gentile nations may enjoy a
portion of the blessings of Messiah's reign, and will not
be effaced from the earth. Some pious Christians, who,
failing to convert men to their peculiar views of revelation,
anticipate the appearance quickly of a sort of
<i>Buonaparte</i> Messiah, armed with similar attributes, who
is to involve all infidel nations in seas of blood, and make
the world a heap of Saharan desolation. Such views of
Christianity have always been abhorrent to my feelings;
and I have kept close to the fair and pacific pictures of
Messiah's reign, so beautifully set forth by Pope:&mdash;</p>

<p>Afternoon, went to see the slaves lately brought from
Bornou. They were as much like merchandize as they<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-259" id="V1-259"></a>[<a href="./images/1-259.png">259</a>]</span>
could be, or human beings could be made to resemble it.
They were entirely naked, with the exception of a strip
of tanned skin tied round the loins. All were nearly
alike, as so many goods packed up of the same quality.
They were very thin, and almost skeletons, about the
age of from ten to fifteen years, with the round Bornouse
features strongly marked upon their countenances. These
slaves are the property of a Tibboo. I invited the Tibboo
home to my house, to glean some information from him.
The Tibboo bought the slaves on speculation in Bornou;
he could now sell them at from forty to fifty dollars
each. He had only six; the Touaricks had thirty-four.
He came from Bornou to Ghat, thence to Ghadames.
He had also some elephants' teeth. The Tibboo pressed
me to buy his slaves; he had not yet found purchasers,
though he had been here some days. The merchants
have no money, or none to buy slaves. The Tibboo
drank some tea with me, which he observed was better
than <i>bouzah</i>, fermented grain liquor. The Tibboo was a
young black, tall and slender, and of mild and not disagreeable
features. There was nothing in him to denote
that he was a common trafficker in human flesh and
blood. He was not so much stamped with the negro
features as his slaves; he was, indeed, as much of a
gentleman as a Presbyterian slave-holder of the United
States, patronized by Doctors Cunningham and Candlish,
and admitted to the fellowship of Free Kirk Saints.
The Tibboo was excessively curious about me, the Christian.
He handled and turned over everything I had.
Seeing my naked (white) arm, he exclaimed, "Whiter
than the moon!" Said did not approve of my new
acquaintance, and declared all the Tibboos rascals; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-260" id="V1-260"></a>[<a href="./images/1-260.png">260</a>]</span>
thinks he recollects that he was made a slave by the
Tibboos. Said was very angry with me for giving the
Tibboo tea&mdash;wouldn't make any more for him&mdash;I might
make it myself. The Tibboo showed his sense of my
attention, by giving me some trona, which he says
abounds in Bornou, and is called <i>konwa</i>. He champs it
in its hard crystalline state, like children champing
sugar-candy. He mixes it with his tobacco, and says it
is pulverized and drank in solution for medicine at Bornou,
like Epsom salts, producing the same effects.</p>

<p>Two people left to-day for Ghat, and two for Timbuctoo.
The latter were the headmen of the large mercantile
firm of Ettanee. It is the custom of Saharan
merchants to send their headmen, and even slaves, to
these distant countries, when circumstances prevent them
going themselves.</p>

<p>My friend the Touatee, who unites in himself a blacksmith
and a silversmith, was this evening employed in
making ladies' ornaments for arms and legs. He was in
the course of finishing a pair of anclets, weighing together
about thirty-eight ounces. Each anclet would
cost 20 dollars. They are for an Arab lady; but, of
course, the husband invests his money in this way until
he can find profitable employment for it, or becomes distressed.
"Meanwhile," says the Touatee, "he has the
kisses of his wife for the investment, and is happier than
if he obtained a hundred per cent. for his outlay of
silver." The old Touatee distinctly recollects Major
Laing passing through Ghadames to Timbuctoo. The
account he gives of him is:&mdash;"When in Ghadames the
Rais (or Major) purchased something of every thing he
could find in our city, as well as specimens of Soudan<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-261" id="V1-261"></a>[<a href="./images/1-261.png">261</a>]</span>
manufacture. He had with him <i>thirty-six bottles of
wine</i>! which I counted. He was attacked by the
Touaricks near Touat, and wounded in twenty places;
but he cured his wounds, and then proceeded on and
arrived safe at Timbuctoo, where he stopped some time.
Afterwards he went to Sansandy, where he was murdered."
The unfortunate Major had no money in his
possession when murdered, which greatly surprised the
assassins, who murdered him merely for his money.
People add, he wrote every thing in Timbuctoo, but did
not stop long there. He was enticed to go away with a
stranger, against the advice of the parties who conducted
him to Timbuctoo. The stranger was a Saharan
Arab. One of them is still living, Haj Kader, and
left lately for Touat, who has the reputation of being
a quiet and upright man. I did not hear of him
until he was gone, otherwise I should have had some
conversation with him about the Major. The other
party died at Timbuctoo; he was called the <i>Marabout</i>,
and seems to have been another Mohammed (my marabout.)
In a letter of the Major, read to me by Colonel
Warrington, his father-in-law, the Major charges his
Marabout with having stolen his double-barrelled gun,
and sent it on to Timbuctoo for sale before they arrived
there. For this theft, and other bad conduct, old Yousef
Bashaw made a formal complaint against the people of
Ghadames, and mulcted them several thousand mahboubs.
Mr. Gagliuffi heard a strange story about the Major; according
to which, he was murdered near Touat, on his
return, by the same Touarick who stopped him, and
wounded him in twenty-six places, on his way thither,
the Touarick alleging, that the Major was not a man but<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-262" id="V1-262"></a>[<a href="./images/1-262.png">262</a>]</span>
a devil, so he (the Touarick) was obliged to kill him<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads ','">.</ins>
No authentic account now will ever be collected of
Major Laing's death. That he was stopped a couple of
days beyond Aghobly, in the oases of Touat, and there
wounded, is certain; we have the Major's own account
for it. He seems also to have remained a month at
Timbuctoo, and wrote a full account of that mysterious
city. He then, not being able to ascend or trace
the Niger <i>vi&acirc;</i> Jinnee, on account of the objections of
the people, made a <i>d&eacute;tour</i> through The Desert,
wishing to go to Senegambia, when, after four days'
journey, he was stopped by a party of Arabs, and
murdered. Some persist in saying, that Cailli&eacute; found
Major Laing's papers, and gave them as his <i>own</i> account
of Timbuctoo. I should be sorry to attempt either to
prove or contradict the charge. All the documents are
in possession of the family of the late Colonel Warrington.
We must suspend our opinion until they are published,
which I trust will not be long.</p>

<p>Afterwards visited the Rais, who is, like myself, very
fond of the Touatee. His Excellency had a bad headache,
and his <i>major-domo</i> was hard at work rubbing his
head with his hands. I laughed, but said nothing. The
people are fond of manipulation, and shampooning
(<i>Temras</i>). Whenever any one hurts himself by bruises
or falls, the limb affected is rubbed and stretched, and
stretched and rubbed, until the poor sufferer's limb is
nearly severed from his body. Manipulation ought to
have made the fourth mode of cure laid down by my
marabout, after burning, blood-letting, and talismanic
writing. However, I believe manipulation, aided by the
bath, frequently effects important cures. Some Moors<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-263" id="V1-263"></a>[<a href="./images/1-263.png">263</a>]</span>
indeed, consider this the sovereign remedy for every
hurt and disease. Found the Touatee again with the
Rais. He amused us both by giving his opinion about
the <i>inexhaustible</i> supply of slaves furnished by Nigritia.
"All other countries," said he, "die and become depopulated.
It is now ten thousand years we go to buy slaves
in Soudan. The oftener we go there the more we find.
In that country the men are all night long begetting
children, and the women all the morning bringing them
forth. This is the reason the supply of slaves never becomes
exhausted."</p>

<p><i>7th.</i>&mdash;Said has just come in and told me I must not
eat many of the dates of this country, for they have
killed some of the soldiers, and will kill me. Dates
may, indeed, injure the poor soldiers, who have nothing
else to eat. One died yesterday. I asked his comrades
what he died of, who replied, "<i>Hunger</i>." It is a
disgrace to the Government of Tripoli to keep these
wretched Arabs without any thing to eat. Why not let
them go to their native mountain homes; for there,
though they may pine away and die in the caverns of the
Atlas, they will nevertheless give up the ghost in the
arms of friends and relations&mdash;joining misery to misery,
where the miserable may comfort the miserable. But,
here, amidst the rude buffs of strangers, it is cruel to let
them die like dogs.</p>

<p>The Tibboo called this morning. Merchants have
offered him only 35 mahboubs each for his slaves; he
asks from 40 to 50. He says, the Americans, or people
nearly as white as I am, ascend the Niger as far as Noufee,
for the purchase of slaves. Bornou and the surrounding
countries are now in peace, and make no slaves by war.<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-264" id="V1-264"></a>[<a href="./images/1-264.png">264</a>]</span>
The Tibboo bought his slaves of persons who kidnapped
them during the night. To observe, that although the
Tibboos, if this merchant be a fair representation of
them, have not such extended nostrils as the Bornouse,
and such thick projecting lips, yet they are much darker
than the Bornouse. Indeed, the Bornouse are of a
lighter, <i>fairer</i> complexion than any of the Negroes I
have yet seen, those of Soudan and Timbuctoo being of a
much darker shade, and some quite black. The Bornouse
has a round, chubby, smiling face; the Tibboo, a
long, grave, intellectual face. The old Touarick bandit
called to-day, with other <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Touraicks'">Touaricks</ins>, and asked how much
I would give for a <i>live aoudad</i>. Told him from 6 to 8
mahboubs. He said they're going to hunt them next
month. This retired cut-throat gave himself a good
character, and the Touaricks generally. "Trust us,
don't be afraid of the Touaricks, upon our heads (<i>raising
his sword to his head</i>,) we'll protect you!" Then stepped
in an old friend and lover of the mysteries of geography.
These are some of his questions:&mdash;"Where is the sea by
which the Christians go to Soudan? Where is Mount
Kaf, that girdles the earth with brass and iron? Where
are Gog and Magog, which is Muskou (<i>Russia</i>), the monster
which eats up the <i>Moumeneen</i> (<i>faithful Mohammedans</i>)?"
&amp;c. Went out and saw for the first time the
Giant Touarick. The huge fellow must be 6 feet 9
inches. His limbs were like the trunks of the palm, and
he walked with a step as firm as a rock; whilst his voice
was a gruff growl like distant thunder. Compare this
noble, though monstrous, specimen of a man, the product
of the wild uncongenial Sahara, to the little ricketty,
squeaking, vivacious wretch of the kindly clime of Italy,<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-265" id="V1-265"></a>[<a href="./images/1-265.png">265</a>]</span>
"the garden of Europe," and be amazed at the ways in
which works Providence! As soon as the giant saw me,
he bellowed out, "Salam aleikom!" which far resounded
through the dark winding streets. He now strode by
without stopping to speak or to look at me, his head and
turban nearly reaching the roof of the streets, and his
big sword, swinging from his back, extended crosswise,
scraping the mortar from both sides of the walls. His
iron spear, as large as an ordinary iron gas-light post,
was carried in his firm fist horizontally, to prevent its
catching the roof of the covered streets. The giant is
one of the chiefs of a powerful tribe of Ghat Touaricks,
of whom the aged Berka is the reigning Sheikh. The
giant is quite at home here and possesses some forty or
fifty camels, with which he conveys the goods of the
merchants between this city and that of Ghat.</p>

<p>After several trials of changing food, find I am
greatly relaxed, and am convinced it must be the water.
This, however, is the opinion of every stranger who
visits Ghadames. Last evening the Rais said, "The
water here is bad. Look at the people of Ghadames,
they have no colour in their cheeks. What a miserable
wretch am I! When I first came, I had the colour of
the rose; now I am become like these yellow men:
as for my poor horse, he eats quantities of barley every
day, and is still very thin. It's the bad water. We
have a proverb in Turkey, 'Good water makes good
horses, and bad water bad horses.'" I observed, the
dates and water together made the soldiers ill. He
replied, "I have written several times to the Pasha to
return, it is impossible for me to enjoy good health here.
His Highness still refuses to allow me, saying, he can<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-266" id="V1-266"></a>[<a href="./images/1-266.png">266</a>]</span>
get no one to fill my post so well, but I hope to return
in a few months." I am inclined to think now that
Ghadames is not salubrious, although, thank God, I
enjoy pretty good health. Strangers, however, require
to be acclimated. A great controversy is now being
carried on amongst the medical men of Algeria, respecting
<i>acclimating</i>; some alleging that a man can bear
the climate of a country when he is quite new or fresh
in it, much better than after a long residence. According
to the anti-acclimaters, the longer residence in a
country only weakens the force necessary to support a
person against the fever and bad influences of a foreign
climate.</p>

<p>Accosted one of my merchant acquaintances, playing
with some iron manacles and fetters for the legs. It
did not strike me at first what they were: at last, he
says to me, "These are for slaves, each has a pair of
them, to prevent them from escaping when travelling
through The Desert." A painful shuddering came over
me to see a man playing with these dreadful instruments
of the slavery and torture of his fellow men. Yet he
played with them as his rosary of beads, or some
simple toy! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Another merchant came up to
him, and observed, "The irons for the neck are better,
as these may break." After a pause, I asked my acquaintance
where these irons for the legs were made?
He replied, "In Soudan; the people there have iron
mountains, and they make these irons for slaves in that
country." I asked him then how much they cost, and
whether he would sell them. They were not for sale.
So Africa enslaves herself! forges the very chains of her
own slavery. Cruel, heartless Europe! Thou that<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-267" id="V1-267"></a>[<a href="./images/1-267.png">267</a>]</span>
knowest better, encouragest the wretched African to
create his own misery; to dig from his dark purple
mountains the very iron fetters of his own slavery!
Take care that slavery does not surprise thee in an
hour when thou thinkest not, though thou art never so
wise, never so free! Another Corsican tyrant may
come and bind thee down anew in the chains of slavery.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Making
inquiries of the Moors about these
fetters, they said, (wishing to smooth down the matter,
seeing it was disagreeable to me), "Only those who seek
to escape are chained." This, indeed, afterwards I
found was the case. "Some," they added, "have irons
on their necks, and others irons on their legs." Alas!
poor people, what have they done to be thus ironed? or
what right have others to iron them? Has God said
"<i>Thou shalt iron thy brother and make him a slave</i>?"
"Yes!" say the free republicans of America, who, for
being taxed for half an ounce of tea, proclaimed their
<i>freedom</i> and independence of the <i>tyranny</i> of the parent
country, in words which, continuing as they are, slave-holders,
must condemn them to everlasting infamy<a name="FNa_1-47" id="FNa_1-47"></a><a href="#FoN_1-47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>.
But, as God lives, he will have a day of reckoning; he
will avenge the wrongs of Africa! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Be sure,
beware America! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Whilst walking through the
streets to-day, in a bad humour on this subject, there
were three Bornou youths, nearly naked, offered for sale,
I think they belonged to the Tibboo. Some Arabs sitting<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-268" id="V1-268"></a>[<a href="./images/1-268.png">268</a>]</span>
near, asked me to buy. I replied, indignantly, "If I buy,
my Sultan will hang me up, and you too." They stared
at one another, and muttered something like a curse
upon me.</p>

<p>I here find several reasons in the journal for my not
proceeding by the route of Fezzan and Bornou, but it is
unnecessary to give them. It is easy to write out a long
list of <i>pro</i> and <i>con</i> reasons. Whilst writing these, the
Tibboo comes in and brings a sick slave. He complains
the merchants will not buy his slaves. Give the dropsical
slave medicine. Ask him whether he ironed his
slaves <i>en route</i> over The Desert. He answers, "No."
I am bound to believe him, for though a slave-dealer, he
appears an honest man.</p>

<p><i>8th.</i>&mdash;O God of the morning! what a fine sight are these
lofty umbrageous palms, with the soft serene morning
sky, and the sun just rising above the clear illumined
horizon, colouring and setting off the heavens around.<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-269" id="V1-269"></a>[<a href="./images/1-269.png">269</a>]</span>
How still, how voiceless is The Desert! The early
morn now begins to be pleasant as the autumnal morn of
old England. It is indeed, the&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Sweet hour of prime."</span>
</div></div>

<p>After breakfast visited the quarter of Ben Weleed.
Saw the giant Touarick stretching his unwieldy length
upon a stone-bench. At sight of me, he aroused himself,
and raising his head upon his huge arm, growled out to
the people near him, to show them his zeal for their
common religion, "Tell the Christian to say, '<i>There is
only one God, and Mahomet is the Prophet of God</i>.'"
No one took any notice of the stern command. After
a moment, the conversation was continued on other subjects,
and the giant fell back again to sleep. I asked an
acquaintance of mine, how long he would sleep? He
told me that whenever the Sheikh comes here, he usually
sleeps three days before he goes round to see his friends,
or begins to transact business, during which time he
occasionally opens his eyes,&mdash;and his mouth, for his
slaves to feed him.</p>

<p>Heard some Souafah, Arabs of Souf, had purchased
the slaves lately come from Bornou, to sell them in
Algeria, there being no market in Tunis on account of
the abolition of slavery. Rais sent for me and asked
me if I had any money left. I thought his Excellency
wanted to lend me some, by putting the question. His
Excellency then said he was in want of money. I lent
him a hundred Tunisian piastres&mdash;all the money I had
in the world, with the exception of seventeen in my
pocket. Afterwards I dined with the Rais, and he persuaded
me to return to The Mountains, <i>en route</i> for<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-270" id="V1-270"></a>[<a href="./images/1-270.png">270</a>]</span>
Fezzan. It is reported, the Touaricks have gone out to
meet the Sh&acirc;nbah. I tell the Governor, as well as the
people, whenever they begin to exaggerate or declaim
upon the dangers of travelling in The Desert "<i>Rubbee,
mout wahad</i> (God! death is but once)." This has
usually the effect of stopping their mouths. Were I not
to adopt this Moslemite style of address and reply, I
should be worried out of my life with the exaggerations
of the dangers of The Desert.</p>

<p>A small caravan has arrived from Souf, bringing the
news of the departure of the Sh&acirc;nbah from Warklah
for Ghat. The Souafah also bring news of interest from
their own country. They are threatened with an invasion
of the people of Tugurt. Twelve hundred men of
Souf have returned from Tunis to their own country, in
expectation of a combined attack of the Tugurt people
and the French, for the Tugurt people have given out
that the French, their new allies, will help them. They
boast that they must now go and destroy all the Souafah.
The object is to revenge an old grudge, for formerly the
people of Souf and Tugurt fought a pitch battle, and
the latter were worsted. There is no French governor
in Tugurt, but the tribute is regularly paid to the
authorities of Constantina. One of the Souafah came
to me much excited. I told him that it was not likely
the French would encourage this war of revenge, and I
understood the principle of the French to be, "to occupy
only the countries which before paid tribute to the Dey
of Algiers." He observed he understood that to be the
rule. But if the Souafah attack Tugurt, the French
will probably defend it as a part of their territory.</p>

<p><i>9th.</i>&mdash;The morning is cool and cloudy; a few drops<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-271" id="V1-271"></a>[<a href="./images/1-271.png">271</a>]</span>
of rain fell soon after sunrise, still it holds up. Amused
in finding the Ghadamsee word for <i>father</i> was the same
as <i>dad</i> or <i>dady</i>, which is written &#8238;&#1583;&#1575;&#1583;&#1575;&#8236; <i>dada</i>. This morning
the giant Touarick honoured me with a visit; he
had enough to do to get through the doors of my house
with his pine-tree spear. He behaved extremely well.
I gave him sixty paras to buy tobacco. He begged for
a whole piastre, but thinking he would be a customer of
this sort again, I thought it prudent to begin with a
little. His giantship swore by all the powers terrestrial
and celestial, that he would escort me from Ghadames
to Kanou in perfect safety. I evaded the question by
observing, (what the Rais had often told me) "The Rais
says the Touaricks will cut my throat." The giant roared,
"<i>Kitheb</i>, kitheb, kitheb, (a lie! a lie! a lie!)"&mdash;and
went off furiously threatening wrath against the Turks.
Afterwards I heard of a complaint which the giant
made against me, saying I had given him this morning a
karoob short of the half piastre. I was greatly amused
at the giant's keen observance of this defalcation of my
generosity.</p>

<p>The Ghadamseeah literally carry out the injunction,
"Take no thought for the morrow," which will be illustrated
in the following conversation.</p>

<p>"What do you do for the poor in your country?"</p>

<p>"In England, the poor are not allowed to beg in the
streets, but are provided with food and clothing in a
house built on purpose for them when they can no longer
work."</p>

<p>"We have no houses for the poor in Ghadames."</p>

<p>"How then do the poor live?"</p>

<p>"By begging."<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-272" id="V1-272"></a>[<a href="./images/1-272.png">272</a>]</span></p>

<p>"And if the people give them nothing?"</p>

<p>"It is destined <i>they must die</i>."</p>

<p>However, in one part of the oasis there are some large
gardens which belong to the poor, who are allowed to
eat the dates and cultivate patches of the gardens. I
think also the Sanctuaries sometimes give alms in the
way of the ancient monasteries. These are miserable
and precarious resources. Nevertheless, before the Turks
so fleeced the inhabitants, I question if there were any
poor person ever likely to die of starvation, for the rich
members of families provide for the poor, and rich friends
for poor friends, and each faction for the poor of the
faction, although no poor-rates are levied. Indeed, like
the Society of Friends, all took care of their own poor
relations and connections.</p>

<p>I shall now give the reader a chapter of the domestic
history of Ghadames, referring to one of the principal
families. Most of the rich merchants of this city have
two and some of them three wives. My venerable
friend, the Sheikh Makouran, came in possession of one
of his present young wives in the following romantic
way. (His wives by whom he had his children are long
ago dead.) A friend of the Sheikh's died and left a
young and beautiful widow, whose wit and grace was the
theme of all the city, for such things are esteemed also
here. The eldest son of the Sheikh immediately set his
heart upon the possession of this beauty, but unfortunately
he did not communicate his intentions to the
disconsolate lady, who remained in ignorance of his
attachment. Meanwhile, El-Besheer, as a party in the
firm of his father, purchased the house over the widow's
head and made everything ready for the future wedding,<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-273" id="V1-273"></a>[<a href="./images/1-273.png">273</a>]</span>
and then took a journey of business to Touat, intending
on his return to send some old lady, which is mostly
the practice, with his message of love and marriage to
the widowed solitary. Perhaps he thought the widow
could not fail to discover his intentions in what he had
already done, mostly preliminary to marriage. But we
often imagine others are thinking about us when we are
never in their thoughts. So he left for twenty days'
journey through The Desert, with all these hopes and
fears crowding about him. On his return, to his consternation,
he found his old father, of some seventy years
of age, had got possession of the young blooming widow,
the object he had so fondly cherished on his weary way
over the solitudes of The Sahara! But like the doomed
Pasha, who receives the imperial order of his decapitation
from the hand of the executioner, and kisses it and then
bows his head to the stroke, so the young merchant, full
of filial veneration for his aged sire, submitted silently
and without a murmur to this cruel decree of heaven.
It is said of the lady that she pines and mourns out her
life for the son. She was kept in profound ignorance
of his love until she found herself in the withered, cold,
and shrunken arms of the father. She accepted the
father to keep a house over her head. Alas! poor
woman, whether sold at Paris or London in a marriage
of <i>convenance</i>, or in The Desert, she is always the
victim of man's galling tyranny.</p>

<p>The Ghadamseeah are a strictly religious people. One
of my best friends would not allow me to touch a religious
book of his, concerning the future world, alleging
it was <i>haram</i> ("prohibited"). A young rogue of a
Touarick now came in and asked me impudently, whether<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-274" id="V1-274"></a>[<a href="./images/1-274.png">274</a>]</span>
I knew God and prayed? He added, "Say Mahomet
is the prophet of God." As several aged men
were present I made no answer. These people believe
that there can be no more question of believing in
Mahomet than in the sun when shining in its full
strength, and are astonished that I who read and write
Arabic don't know better. One said, "You are afraid
of scorpions, believe in Mahomet and they will do you
no harm." I could not help thinking of the parallel, for
all Oriental phraseology is so much alike:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Serpents and scorpions" have a peculiar application to
The Desert. There are still more dangerous animals in
The Desert, and I have heard the epithet of "a race of
vipers," applied to the Sh&acirc;nbah banditti. This morning
the people showed me a wooden figure of a fiddler, placed
on a box, in which was inserted a handle, turning round
and making a squeaking noise. None of them could
understand what it was. A boy was playing with it as
a toy. They told me, as news, "This came from the
country of the Christians; it ought not to have been
made, it is <i>haram</i>." All toys of men and animals are
considered by these rigid Moslems as so many violations
of the commandment "Thou shalt not make unto thyself
any graven image."</p>

<p>According to my turjeman there are many <i>Wahabites</i>
in this neighbourhood. Besides Jerbah and its mountains,
many Wahabites are found in the Tripoline districts
of Nalout, Kabou, Fessatou, Temzeen and Keklah. The
Ghadamsee people detest them and say; "The Waha<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-275" id="V1-275"></a>[<a href="./images/1-275.png">275</a>]</span>bites
will be the carriers of the Jews to hell-fire in the next
world." The Wahabites assert, there are five orthodox
sects, of which they form the fifth, and hate cordially the
other four. Wahabites have great difficulty in eating
with other Mussulmans, and some refuse absolutely to eat
with other than their own sect. Wahabites are very numerous
in the oasis of Mezab, belonging to Algeria, which
is confirmed by the Morocco marabout <i>El A&iuml;achi</i>, who
made his pilgrimage to Mecca in 1661. The Wahabites
of Jerbah are subdivided in the <i>Abadeeah</i>, or <i>The Whites</i>,
who wear a <i>white</i> scull-cap, in contradistinction from those
who wear <i>red</i> caps, like most Mussulmans of the coast.
Generally the Wahabites differ from other Mohammedans
as to the observance of the <i>five</i> daily prayers. They
also require that, in the observance of the Ramadan, a
person should purify and wash himself at the hour of the
day in which the fast may begin. The sub-sect of
Abadites will neither eat nor drink from the same
vessel with any other sects. Wahabites in general will
not weigh or touch weights, for fear of doing wrong.
Other persons do weighing for them, they looking on,
like the Jews who will not touch the candle on their
Sabbath, and get Mussulman or Christian servants to
snuff a candle or trim a lamp for them. It seems what
is a sin in them, may or may not be a sin in others.</p>

<p>My turjeman is surprised we Christians receive the
books of the Jews as sacred and inspired, and so are
many other people. They are quite astonished when I
tell them that Christians esteem the Scriptures of the
Jews equally divine with their own. They have a confused
notion that the whole of the Jewish Scriptures
consist of the five books of Moses, which they call the<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-276" id="V1-276"></a>[<a href="./images/1-276.png">276</a>]</span>
<i>Torat</i>, and the Psalms of David. Some of them say
Abraham was not a Jew. I explain to them, that the
Christians give a different interpretation to the Jewish
Scriptures from the Jews themselves, and believe "the
Son of Mary" to be the Messiah of the Jews and all the
world. They hardly believe me; and say, "The Jews
are corrupt and their books corrupt." When I told them
one day before the Rais that we had had Jews in India,
they flatly replied it was a lie, for said they, "It is
impossible for such a miserable being as a Jew to be a
soldier."</p>

<p><i>10th.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">A beautiful</span> morning, and cool. I saw with
some surprise a very fine red butterfly, also a small
flight of good-sized birds passing over the gardens.</p>

<p>This morning there was a grand gormandizing of
bazeen<a name="FNa_1-48" id="FNa_1-48"></a><a href="#FoN_1-48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>, in celebration of the nuptials of the two daughters
of my taleb. The feast was given by the fathers of
the young men. Nearly the whole of the male population
of the <i>Ben Wezeet</i>, besides strangers and the Arab soldiers,
went to dig, and dip, and dive into the huge bowl
of bazeen, some three or four hundred adults, besides
boys. The house was small, and parties entering together
were limited to twenty. However, as the object is
merely to compliment the new married people and their
parents, after they had swallowed half a dozen mouthsful,
they immediately retired and left the coast clear for
the rest, and thus the ceremony was soon got through.<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-278" id="V1-278"></a>[<a href="./images/1-278.png">278</a>]</span>
There was an exception in the case of the soldiers, whose
hungry stomachs found the bazeen so good that they
stuck fast to the bowl, and <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'was'">were</ins> obliged to receive the
Irish hint of being pulled away by main force before
they would relinquish their tenacious grasp. My taleb,
as a matter of course, called upon me to go to the
festa. I found the festive hall to be a smallish oblong
room, the walls of which were garnished with a number
of little looking-glasses, polished brass basons, and various
other small matters, including little baskets made of
palm-branches. The floor was covered with matting and
a few showy carpets, and one or two ottomans were
arranged for seats. In the centre of the room was
placed an enormous wooden dish, full of bazeen, or thick
boiled pudding, made of barley-meal, with olive-oil, and
sauce of pounded dates poured upon it. Every person
ate with his hands, rolling the pudding into balls, and
dipping the balls into oil and date-sauce. A great piece
of carpetting was laid round the bowl, to be used as a
napkin to wipe the hands and mouth. The wooden dish
or bowl might have been three feet in diameter, and was
replenished as fast as emptied with masses of boiled
dough, oil, and date-sauce. There was suspended over it,
two or three feet above, a wicker roof, to prevent the dirt
from falling into it when the people stood up all around
and wiped their hands. The visitors squatted down
together, encircling the bowl, in numbers of about eight or
ten. An Arab, who had a lump given him in a corner,
like a dog, found fault with it and returned it, saying,
"It is not enough." This, of course, was delicate, but
another lump was given him, for which also he growled
dissatisfaction. This <i>feeding</i> of bazeen was the fullest<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-279" id="V1-279"></a>[<a href="./images/1-279.png">279</a>]</span>
extent of the good things of the feast. Some of the
more respectable merchants went in and out without
tasting the bazeen, merely paying the compliment to
their friends. I asked an acquaintance how much he
thought a feast of this sort cost. He replied, "About
twenty dollars, but it is not the value of the materials of
the feast, but the custom, which is esteemed." Not one
of the Ben Weleed were present, but all the Wezeet
deemed it their duty to attend the feast. The marriage
feast is some eight days after the marriage. Last night
there was a little firing of matchlocks. After marriage,
the bridegroom cannot mix with his acquaintances for
two or three weeks. It is a sort of decamping after
marriage, as if the parties had done something of which
they were ashamed, like in travelling honey-moons
amongst ourselves. But at certain hours of the day the
bridegroom may be seen gliding about like a spectre in
the dark streets, alone and with noiseless tread. He
usually is dressed in gayest colours of blue and scarlet,
with a fine long stave of brass, or a bright iron spear in
his hand. When he is met by any one he instantly
vanishes: he does not utter a syllable, and no person
attempts to speak to him.</p>

<p>This afternoon and evening was also a <i>native</i> feast of
the slaves. They first danced and sung in the market-place.
Afterwards they visited the <i>tombs</i>, and prayed
to their dead relatives, propitiating their manes, and "to
be restored to them and liberty at their death." The
women carried chafing-dishes in their hands, on which
burnt fragrantly the incense of <i>bekhour</i>. The pride of
men perpetuate their distinctions beyond life to the land
of the dead, where one would think the ashes of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-280" id="V1-280"></a>[<a href="./images/1-280.png">280</a>]</span>
human body should be allowed freely to return to the
essential elements of our common mother, Earth. So
slaves have their place of burial, and must not commingle
their bones with those of freemen. From the grave-yard
and its sadness, the slaves proceeded to a garden, alotted
to them, where they danced, and sung, and forgot their
slavery. Besides dancing and singing, the slaves occasionally
fired off matchlocks, which they had borrowed
from their masters or friends, and of which they are
most immoderately fond. The high military chivalry of
Europe, and France, who calls herself <i>m&egrave;re de l'&eacute;p&eacute;e</i>, are
well matched by the savage tribes and slaves of enslaved
Africa, who all delight in the slash and cut of the sword,
and the banging noise of the gun. The negresses sat
apart, as usual, occasionally raising their shrill <i>loo-looings</i>,
which they have well learnt from their Moorish mistresses.
They were very gaily attired, some with their arms
covered with bracelets and armlets, six or seven pairs of
very broad tin or silver hoops being fitted on or encircling
one single arm; so that the arms of some of these sable
beauties were an entire mass of metal. The party mustered
about a hundred, and the Tibboo stranger was
here, attracted by the colour of skin and native associations.
Several people went from the city to see the
slaves' festival&mdash;I amongst the rest. It would be great
injustice if I were not to add, that the Moorish inhabitants
of Ghadames ordinarily treat their slaves well; they
have a good deal of leisure, if not liberty; and their lot,
as compared with the slaves of the cotton and sugar
plantations of Christians, <i>is liberty itself</i>,&mdash;so differently
do religions affect, or not affect at all, the morality of the
people who profess them. To judge from this obvious<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-281" id="V1-281"></a>[<a href="./images/1-281.png">281</a>]</span>
case of comparison, which is so notorious through all The
East and North Africa, as contrasted with the Christian
States of America, the religion of the impostor of Mecca
should be the religion of the divine morals of the New
Testament, and the religion of The Saviour be the corrupt
morals of the Koran. But if we were to judge of a
religion and its morals from those who profess it, our
ideas would soon get into confusion, and we should fall
into the most deplorable errors.</p>

<p>Began to-day to acquire a few words of the Nigritian
languages. People are such geese, that when I learnt
half-a-dozen words of what some call the "<i>black</i>" language,
they thought me a prodigy. The Housa is the
best and most frequently spoken language here of the
Nigritian tongues. A New Testament, translated into
this language, would or could be read by a third of the
tribes of Central Africa. Asking my negro master what
<i>I</i> was, he replied, "<i>Kerdee</i>," which means <i>kafer</i> ("infidel")
in Bornou, the negro mistaking my individual self for
the pronoun <i>I</i>, which is <i>oomah</i>. I laughed heartily at
the fellow's impudence.</p>

<p>This afternoon, visited the ancient tower, about half a
mile distant, westwards, from the walls of Ghadames.
My turjeman, who was <i>cicerone</i>, informed me that the
tower was built by the Christians, and was a watch-tower
to give alarm to the city in case of an attack from
banditti or other enemies. There is another like it in
the mountains to the north-west, where are also scattered
some old masonry of other buildings. We mounted the
top of the tower, and found a hollowed space at the top,
of this shape<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-282" id="V1-282"></a>[<a href="./images/1-282.png">282</a>]</span>&mdash;</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill1-12.jpg"><img src="./images/ill1-12_th.jpg" alt="Cistern of an Ancient Tower" title="Cistern of an Ancient Tower" /></a></p>

<p>twenty feet long, eight broad, and about five deep. It
was evidently a cistern or tank for the troops, for we
saw a hole at the broad end, from which the water ran
out. The tower itself was about forty feet in diameter<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added period to text">.</ins>
How high it had been, we could not now tell; but
the cistern is placed nearly at the top of what remains
of the tower. Probably the water ran down into the
lower rooms. From the tops of the ruins there was
a commanding view of the oasis, and the surrounding
Desert. On our way we passed a very deep, dry
well, and the wall-remains of several ancient gardens.
The turjeman says the water of Ghadames diminishes,
and was formerly much more abundant.</p>

<p><i>11th.</i>&mdash;This morning cooler than any yet. My eyes
are now nearly restored from the attack of ophthalmia
which I had in Tripoli; they open always with a little
pain in the morning. It is frightful to observe how
many people here have their eyes injured. A poor
camel-driver said to me, "Alas! since I went that road
to Ghat, I have been nearly blind. The sand and rock
were too bright for them."</p>

<p>An Algerine Arab arrived with those of Souf, a
species of vagrant marabout, bringing with him all the
lax liberal ideas of French Mussulmans. I thought at<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-283" id="V1-283"></a>[<a href="./images/1-283.png">283</a>]</span>
first he had been sent as a spy, to see what I myself was
doing at Ghadames. The pious Ghadamseeah were confounded
at his discourses, as he held forth in the streets.
He was very clever and facetious, now and then affecting
the saint&mdash;now the reformer. When he was gone, I
asked the people what they thought of him. They
replied, "He's spoilt&mdash;he's a <i>French</i> Mussulman&mdash;he'll
soon be an infidel." Others said, "He's mad." This
stranger brings the news that all is peace in Algeria.
One of the people asked him, "Whether it was really
true that the French had got so far into the interior as
Constantine?" The Algerine says also, Abdel-Kader is
escaped to The Desert. The Emir had been at war
with the French during the summer. My taleb, speaking
of the French, observed, "Buonaparte had no father." I
endeavoured in vain to persuade him to the contrary;
and pressing him to tell me under whose influence he was
begotten, he at last said, "You think I'm a fool, but his
father was one of the Jenoun ("demons").<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added missing quotation mark">"</ins> This is rather
a good ancestry, for the Jenoun are, on the whole, a
harmless, pleasant sort of people, a disposition which the
war-loving tyrant Corsican rarely showed.</p>

<p><i>12th.</i>&mdash;Rose earlier than usual, before sunrise, in
order to go to the marabet<a name="FNa_1-49" id="FNa_1-49"></a><a href="#FoN_1-49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> of Sidi-M&acirc;bed&mdash;&#8238;&#1587;&#1610;&#1583;&#1610; &#1605;&#1614;&#1593;&#1624;&#1576;&#1583;&#8236;.
My turjeman had married his wife from this
place, and therefore accompanied me. He said, "I
married one of the daughters of the Saint, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-284" id="V1-284"></a>[<a href="./images/1-284.png">284</a>]</span>
his blood runs in the veins of my children." In all
The Desert we find this aristocracy of the gentle
blood of the Saints. Sidi-M&acirc;bed is two miles and
a half from Ghadames due west. It is situate upon the
slope of a small valley, which might formerly have
been the bed of a river. To look at this speck of
an oasis, its appearance is not unlike that of Seenawan.
Around, and near the little village, which may consist
of some fifteen very lowly dwellings, is a cluster
of palms, and further on are two or three single ones,
scattered over the sloping valley. At the furthest distance
are some patches of cultivation, the water running
gurgling down to them. The gardens are of the same
character as those of Ghadames. The inhabitants consist
of some seventy souls, all the descendants of one
man, the famous saint who has given his name to the
village. But according to the account of his sons, his
offspring has not increased very fast, for it is several
hundred years,&mdash;even 900 say they&mdash;since His Maraboutship
flourished. Some place him as far back as the
Flood. It is said that Nimroud did not place his iron
hoof on this sacred spot. The daughters of the Saint
marry away, only the sons remain in the oasis, and some
of these emigrate, which accounts for the smallness of the
Saint's offspring.</p>

<p>The children of this Saint, like many a saint himself,
are very ignorant, and only one of them pretends to
read and write, and to-day he was unfortunately not in
the oasis. Those with whom I conversed were simple
rude peasants, but polite in their manners, with countenances
speaking a serenity of soul and happiness of
disposition, not common to the inhabitants of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-285" id="V1-285"></a>[<a href="./images/1-285.png">285</a>]</span>
Saharan regions. They told me their village was
<i>Zaweea</i> ("a sanctuary"), and was recorded in the sacred
archives of Constantinople as one of the most renowned
places in the countries of the Prophet. It is, at any rate,
one of the most venerated sanctuaries in the Sahara,
and receives pious offerings from all. Amidst wars and
tumults, and the depredations of banditti without and
around, it remains secure and inviolate and inviolable.
This has been its happy destiny through ages, and the
villagers, poor and ignorant as they are, may be proud
of their sacred unpolluted home. We have here a
remarkable instance of the triumph of religious principle
over brute force. The people of Ghadames make
continual pilgrimages to the shrine of the Saint. The
villagers brought our party dates, and all the women and
children came out to look at me; the same jealous
feelings do not exist amongst these unsuspecting untutored
people as in Ghadames and other Desert cities.
A happy thought occurred to me before I came away in
the morning, of bringing them some wedding-cakes and
sweets which had been sent to me: these I brought,
with several loaves of bread. They received them very
gratefully, dividing them among the whole population of
seventy people, a morsel for each. They have no wheaten
bread here; they live not on the "fat of the land," as the
Christian poverty-vowing monks of our own and past
times. These Desert saints are content with a scanty
supply of barley-meal, a little olive-oil, and a few dates.
I had been told they did not approve of holding <i>Ben-Adam</i>
as slaves, and was greatly disappointed to hear
a reply from one of them, "If we had money we would
have slaves; we have no slaves, because we have no<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-286" id="V1-286"></a>[<a href="./images/1-286.png">286</a>]</span>
money." By the way, the poverty of North Africa and
The Sahara is one of the principal causes of the few
domestic slaves now kept, in comparison with former
times.</p>

<p>When we had been in the village a few minutes, an
Arab soldier came hastily after us. He was sent by the
Rais, who was frightened out of his wits, his Excellency
giving out, that I should be attacked by banditti.
His Excellency said, on my return, "<i>Why, why?</i> (apparently
displeased, many people being with him,) whenever
you go out, come to me, and I will give you an
armed Arab soldier." He added; "You and I will go
and see the Zaweea on horseback." The fact is, some of
the people were jealous of a Christian going to their
sacred village, and considered it a pollution, and the Rais
was obliged to make a show of opposition and displeasure.
The children of the Saint manifested none of
these exclusive jealous feelings, and were happy to see
me. In the course of an hour, though my turjeman and
myself came off early and secretly, it was known all over
the city the Christian had gone to the sanctuary, and
the more bigoted were not a little excited. In the
village, although everything has the appearance of the
most abject poverty, all is bright and clean. The tomb
of the Saint remains, but is concealed from the world,
enveloped in profound mystery, suitable to the exciting
of superstitious feelings. In the gardens were many
pretty butterflies. I noticed a single cotton-tree, and
gathered two or three ripe pods; the tree looked unhealthy
and was very dwarfish. The Sahara is not the
place for cotton growing; formerly, however, cotton was
grown at Carthage, the Jereed, and other parts of North<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-287" id="V1-287"></a>[<a href="./images/1-287.png">287</a>]</span>
Africa. Sir Thomas Reade has lately tried cotton-growing
on the lands of Carthage, but not succeeded very
well. We went to see the date-trees, and seeing one a
mere bush, without a trunk, I said; "How long has that
been so, will it ever bear dates?" A son of the Saint
said; "That tree has been there as long as I can remember.
It was always so. Date-trees are like mankind,
some are tall, some are dwarfish, some fat, some
lean, some bear fruit and others are barren. The root
descends into the earth as low as the length of a man.
God created this place and gave us this garden. We
and our children shall keep it until the Judgment-day!
From this garden we shall ascend to that of paradise,
where we shall have dates always ripe and ready for
eating, for every tree is large and fruitful there. And
no man dare touch these trees without our permission,
not even the Rais or the Bashaw. We pay nothing to
any man; all cast before us their offerings. But we
have little because we want little. Such is the will of
God." Here then is the abode of inviolate sanctity!
here sits the protecting genius of Ghadames, like a
pelican in the wilderness! I observed again to-day the
burnt volcanic stones scattered over The Desert. They
were of all colours, yellow, black, brown, and red, like so
many brick-bats. These stones scattered for miles
around, together with the hot-spring of the city, and
many of the low dull Saharan hills, like so many heaps
of scori&aelig; and lava, give apparently a volcanic origin to
all these regions, or render such a supposition probable.</p>

<p>In full Divan it was decided this morning to clear out
a little the hot-spring and its ducts running to the gardens,
in order to give the flow of water more room. Some old<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-288" id="V1-288"></a>[<a href="./images/1-288.png">288</a>]</span>
people say their fathers cleaned it out, and the water ran
more abundantly; the deeper their fathers dug the well,
the more the water gushed out. Others are opposed to
the innovation, opposed to all change, being the good old
Tories of the Saharan city. All the people are to go in
a few days and set to work at this cleaning, that means
their slaves. Went to see this evening a sick Touarick,
out of town in his tent, and gave him some medicine;
but shall be obliged to leave off distributing soon, for the
most useful medicines are nearly all finished.</p>

<p><i>13th.</i>&mdash;Weather becomes daily cooler. Get tired of
writing, and wish to be off in The Desert. A courier
from The Mountains has arrived, bringing a note from
Ahmed Effendi, who says, "The people of Ghadames
have no occasion to send a deputation to Tripoli. They
must pay the extraordinary demand of 3,000 mahboubs
at once, without farther dispute or delay." People are
in consternation; they all say they've no more money.
My taleb assures me he was obliged to sell two of his
shirts to make up the last amount of the regular tax.
What is to be done for extraordinary demands? The
fortifications of <i>Emjessem</i> are to be immediately rebuilt.
The mud and salt walls are to be destroyed, and new
ones of stone and lime are to replace them. Rais
showed me the plan of the fonduk, which was nearly
executed. This looks like perseverance on the part of
the Turks, and shows their determination to keep open
the communication between this and Tripoli. The fonduk,
or caravanseria, will be eighty feet long and thirty
wide. It is to be built by the people of Ghadames, who,
whilst working, will be protected by sixty Arab troops.
The expense to be also paid by Ghadames. Rais is<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-289" id="V1-289"></a>[<a href="./images/1-289.png">289</a>]</span>
going to see the works begin. Besides the new fonduk,
Rais has taken the precaution of stopping up a well, a
day's journey north-east from the city, by rolling into it
a huge stone. This is for the same object, to prevent
brigands coming near the city and lying in wait for small
caravans and isolated travellers. Fifty sheep were
brought into Souk to-day; they were immediately sold.
People fatten them for the <i>Ayd-Kebir</i>, each family
endeavouring to procure one as a religious obligation.</p>

<p><i>14th.</i>&mdash;Went early this morning to <i>Ben Weleed</i> to
find my aged friend, Sheikh Ali. He has the largest
species of dates, and invited me to go to his garden to
see the palms.</p>

<p>Sheikh Ali is a man of ancient days, and ancient
honour and resources, and fallen into a very low estate.
He has not only outlived his age and reputation, but
outlived his wealth and riches and has become "poor
indeed." A long flowing white beard now covers his
receding breast, and the wrinkles of ninety years furrow
his pale brow and sunken cheeks. Nevertheless, dignity,
though ruined, is stamped on his countenance, and
an almost youthful activity and hale health keep up the
great burden of his years. On arriving at the old man's
garden, he told me to follow him, and coming to a very
fine lofty palm, with over-hanging wide-spreading boughs,
he sat down under its ample shade, and bade me sit
by his side. "Christian," he said, "I have sat under the
shade of this palm all the days of my life, and shall
recline here till God summons me hence."</p>

<p>"How old are the longest-lived palms?" I returned.</p>

<p>"More than the ages of three old men's lives," observed
the Sheikh.<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-290" id="V1-290"></a>[<a href="./images/1-290.png">290</a>]</span></p>

<p>An old slave, as ancient-looking as his master, now
brought a basket of dates, they were every one of them
larger than our largest walnuts. I am vexed I have forgotten
the name of this splendid variety of the date.
"Eat," said Sheikh Ali, and reclined back in silence for
at least half an hour. Now and then he opened his
eyes to look on the autumnal beams of the rising sun,
then breathed a sigh and a prayer, but did not address
me a word. His ancient slave sat at a distance with his
eyes fixed on his beloved master, watching the movement
of his lips, as he breathed his morning prayer. At
length, seeing the old man's lips cease to move, I said
gently:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sheikh Ali, they say you have broken down very
much, but I am glad to see you confide your sorrows in
the bosom of God."</p>

<p><i>Sheikh Ali.</i>&mdash;(Awakening up suddenly, and looking at
me anxiously) "Ah, Christian, have they told you so?
The detractors, the wretches!"</p>

<p>"I trust I have not offended you."</p>

<p><i>Sheikh Ali.</i>&mdash;"No, stranger, no. But I hate them. I
hate the world. I curse the world."</p>

<p>"The unfortunate and disappointed are always bitter
upon the world. But you, Sheikh Ali, I know are above
spite and malignity: you would not stoop even to hate
the miserable follies of the world."</p>

<p><i>Sheikh Ali.</i>&mdash;"Christian, thou talkest well, and in my
way. I tell thee I hate no one, I have lived and I shall
soon be done with the world. May those who come after
me fare better."</p>

<p>"What is this hatred of the Ben Weleed and the
Ben Wezeet?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-291" id="V1-291"></a>[<a href="./images/1-291.png">291</a>]</span></p>

<p><i>Sheikh Ali.</i>&mdash;(Smiling faintly.) "Christian, thou wilt
know everything. My father told me when I came out
of the belly of my mother, that I was a <i>Ben Wezeelee</i>,
and I have remained so to this day. But why or wherefore,
I know not? Dost thou not see that people do this
and that, and know not why they do it? Well, Christian,
we do not hate the Ben Wezeet; but we will not
associate with them, because we are proud, and because
our fathers did not associate with them. It is pride, not
hatred, which divides this our nation into two."</p>

<p>"Why so proud? It says in the Koran the Devil
would not admire Adam for pride<a name="FNa_1-50" id="FNa_1-50"></a><a href="#FoN_1-50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>, and God cursed him
for his pride."</p>

<p><i>Sheikh Ali.</i>&mdash;"Ah, Christian, how knowest thou the
Koran? Canst thou read the Great and Mighty Koran?"</p>

<p>"In England we read the Koran in order to obtain a
correct knowledge of classic Arabic. Others read it to
understand the religion of Moslems."</p>

<p><i>Sheikh Ali.</i>&mdash;"Right, right. The Christians are a
wise people. Oh, these religions!"</p>

<p>I thought I heard a regret of scepticism, or a kindly
view of heretics and infidels, in the latter exclamation,
"<i>Oh, these religions!</i>" So I observed to the Sheikh, "A<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-292" id="V1-292"></a>[<a href="./images/1-292.png">292</a>]</span>
pity it is we are not all of one religion, as we are all the
children of one Creator."</p>

<p><i>Sheikh Ali.</i>&mdash;"By G&mdash;&mdash;! Christian, thou art right.
I have always prayed God to lead me in the right way,
and to have mercy upon others. But do you know,
Christian, I think there were amongst those prophets of
ancient times many impostors. What do you think?"</p>

<p>"I am sure of it. It is also the opinion of all our
wise men in England."</p>

<p><i>Sheikh Ali.</i>&mdash;"Christian, I hate Marabouts. In the
long years of my life I have seen all their tricks, lies,
and impositions. I am sorry for the poor people, on
whom they practise their impostures, and also for the
women. I have one daughter; I never permitted her to
consult a marabout. I told her what the wretches were.
Have you marabouts in England?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of all descriptions. We have also many who
get the women to confess the secrets of families, and
create an odious war in the bosom of society."</p>

<p><i>Sheikh Ali.</i>&mdash;"Ah, ah (chuckling), all the world's
alike. God curse those marabouts. Do you give them
money?"</p>

<p>"Money! In our country, nothing is done without
money."</p>

<p><i>Sheikh Ali.</i>&mdash;(Becoming fresh excited.) "What! are
the English like us? is a man esteemed for his money?"</p>

<p>"You have heard of London?"</p>

<p><i>Sheikh Ali.</i>&mdash;"<i>Londra?</i>"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's it. Well, in Londra, nor virtue, nor
honour, nor wisdom, is worth anything without money."</p>

<p><i>Sheikh Ali.</i>&mdash;"The Devil take the world, it's all alike.
So here, so there. When I was rich, everybody bowed<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-293" id="V1-293"></a>[<a href="./images/1-293.png">293</a>]</span>
down to me; now that I am poor, they pass me by without
saying <i>bis-slamah</i> (saluting). Why did God make
money? How wretched is the world." So this philosopher
of The Desert continued. Returning, I bade the
ancient Sheikh an affectionate adieu.</p>

<p>In the streets, people appeared to be fasting, as in the
most rigid Ramadan. I never saw such gloomy, emaciated
faces. Really people look as if they were all going
to give up the ghost. What is to become of these poor
devils of dervishes! Government is grinding them down
to the dust! Returned home heart-sick at the sight. I
am growing daily more impatient of remaining so long
in Ghadames. Impatience comes on like attacks of
fever. Have determined again to pursue the Kanou
route.</p>

<p>The forty slaves brought by the Touaricks and the
Tibboo have been all sold to the Souafah. The Tibboo
sold his for twenty dollars per head. The ten dollars per
head tax on them put the Rais in possession of a little
ready money, and his Excellency paid me back the hundred
Tunisian piastres. The Arabs of Souf always
bring money here, and, besides dollars, a quantity of
five-franc pieces, since the French have occupied Algeria.
The millions spent or wasted by the French in Algeria
are variously disposed of:&mdash;</p>

<p>1st.&mdash;The Arabs get a <i>fifth</i>, who bury their money,
or send it into the neighbouring deserts of Tunis and
Morocco.</p>

<p>2nd. The Maltese ship off a <i>ninth</i> of the money to
Malta. The Spaniards and other foreigners also get a
share.</p>

<p>3rd. A great quantity, a fifth, perhaps, is embezzled<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-294" id="V1-294"></a>[<a href="./images/1-294.png">294</a>]</span>
by the <i>employ&eacute;s</i> of the civil administration, and their
creatures, the contractors.</p>

<p>4th. A tenth is spent on the public works.</p>

<p>5th. The rest is paid to the military. A <i>fraction</i>
only is spent on the culture of the soil, and for the purposes
of emigration, or the real colonization of the
country.</p>

<p><i>15th.</i>&mdash;This morning is really cold, and the coldest
morning we have had yet. Rais assures me I shall with
difficulty be able to bear the cold, so intense is it in
Ghadames during the winter, or January and February.
Greatly agitated about my journey in the past night, and
could not sleep. There will soon be an end of this uncertainty.
I pray God to give me patience and wisdom.
Observe people are beginning to feel the effects of the
cold, and cover up their mouths like the Italians and
Spaniards. But all are living up to the starvation-point.</p>

<p>At noon was held a full Divan, to decide upon the
"extraordinary demand." The chiefs of the people
said:&mdash;"We have no money, and cannot pay." The
Rais replied:&mdash;"Such discourse will not do; you have
money, and must pay." Then the Divan broke up without
farther palavering. The alleged object of the
money to be raised, is for the expenses of the troops who
went in pursuit of the Arabs of the son of Abd-el-Geleel
in the past summer.</p>

<p>The old bandit calls and says:&mdash;"Your friend, the
<i>long</i> man, has finished to-day all his tobacco." The long
man is the Giant Touarick. I took no notice of this
polite hint to furnish a new supply. I might furnish
with tobacco all the Touaricks who came here, if I were<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-295" id="V1-295"></a>[<a href="./images/1-295.png">295</a>]</span>
to attend to these Irish hints. The old bandit, who is
cramped up like a wizened apple, is said by people still
to carry on his nefarious trade. The proof of this they
give to be, his always <i>going alone</i> when he travels. The
old villain then catches what he can. Myself, I hardly
believe he continues his brigandage. He appears wholly
worn out. I gave his little son 20 paras to buy camel's
flesh. The old freebooter grinned a ghastly smile.
Walking in <i>Ben Weleed</i> quarters, I heard a great to-do, and
went to see what it was, when I saw the old chief, Haj
Ben Mousa Ettanee, standing over his young truant son,
whilst with a thick stick the servant of the schoolmaster
was belabouring the feet of the child. Never was a
more complete bastinadoing. The urchin cried to his
father for mercy. It was perfectly in character with the
old man, and the austere manners of his family. I
do not wonder that all the people read and write in
Ghadames, when such severity is practised by the very
aristocrats of the city. Whilst standing by, another
Moor went up to the old man, and said, "Stop, stop,
here's the Christian looking on." They stopped, but it
appeared a mere pretence for leaving off, for already
they had unmercifully belaboured the truant.</p>

<p>No mutton to be had to-day, and was obliged to buy
camel's flesh for dinner: found it pretty good. My
turjeman and taleb both joined me. After dinner, the
taleb began in his usual controversial spirit. He insisted,
that "Any person who should make himself well
acquainted with the Koran must become a Mussulman."
"If the French teach their children to read the Koran,
in order to learn the Arabic," said he, "they must conquer
the Russians and the English." Not <span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-296" id="V1-296"></a>[<a href="./images/1-296.png">296</a>]</span>"<ins class="grk" title="Greek: en tout&ocirc; nicha">&#949;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#965;&#964;&#969; &#957;&#953;&#967;&#945;</ins><a name="FNa_1-51" id="FNa_1-51"></a><a href="#FoN_1-51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>,"
but in or with <i>This Book</i>, say the Mussulmans,
the world must be conquered. The Russians and the
French, having recently made conquests in Mohammedan
countries near them, (for the wars in Circassia are heard
of here,) impress these people with fear, and fear is their
ruling principle of government. Asking my taleb why
the Mussulmans who had possession of <i>This Book</i> did
not conquer the world, he answered sharply, "The Mussulmans
conquered the world once with the Koran, but
now they have lost their faith, and are weak, and such is
the will of God." The taleb then related a curious story
about Ceuta. A certain marabout, who had seen the
<i>Elouh Elmahfouth</i> (&#8238;&#1575;&#1604;&#1608;&#1581; &#1575;&#1604;&#1605;&#1581;&#1601;&#1608;&#1592;&#8236;,) or "Book of Fate,"
which was let down to him to look at and read in, from
heaven, went into the city, and offered Ceuta for sale at
the low price of "<i>a loaf of bread</i>." The people said:&mdash;"Oh,
the man is mad, let him go." But he continued
the more to cry out, "Who will give me a loaf of bread
for Ceuta?" At last he met a Christian, a Spaniard,
who gave the Marabout a loaf of bread, and took possession
of the city. This seems really an excuse for the
loss of that strong fortress. But it is added:&mdash;"The
Marabout having seen and read the future destiny of
Ceuta in the <i>Book of Fate</i>, was determined to hasten
the crisis, and placed it at once in the hands of the
Christians." My taleb assures me that Mahomet was
foretold and promised in our gospels, under the name of
<i>Parakleit</i>, (<i>i. e.</i> <ins class="grk" title="Greek: ho Parakl&ecirc;tos">&#8001; &#928;&#945;&#961;&#8049;&#954;&#955;&#951;&#964;&#959;&#962;</ins>,), "The Comforter." He
cited also the Koran, but would not write the passage; I
had no Koran with me. But this is an advantage, for if<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-297" id="V1-297"></a>[<a href="./images/1-297.png">297</a>]</span>
I had had a Koran in my possession, I should only have
excited the prejudices of the people against me, and
should not have been able to have kept it from them.
A traveller might take a translation advantageously, one
without Arabic notes, or <i>Arabic</i> words explained, which
would soon excite their curiosity to know what it was.
Speaking of the "<i>Ben Welleed</i>" and "<i>Wezeet</i>," my
turjeman said:&mdash;"These are the French and the English;
we are always at war with one another."</p>

<p>It is the opinion of people here, that the French and
English are always at war, and they are continually on
the <i>qui-vive</i> for a war breaking out between France and
England, for they think then the English will drive out
the French from Algeria, unmindful of what miseries
such a war would entail upon themselves, crushed as
they would be between the two great hostile Powers.</p>

<p>The Algerine dervish is playing off some fine tricks.
This afternoon he got together a dozen low fellows of the
Ben Weleed, and went to say the <i>fatah</i> before the Governor.
This saying <i>fatah</i> was chiefly forming a circle
with his troop, himself in the middle, and then at the
top of his voice singing out, whilst his troop cried out,
"<i>hhahh</i>," jumping up, and bending forward their heads
and bodies towards him. This they continued for an
hour or more, until they sank upon the floor with exhaustion.
Afterwards they played off some other genteel
tricks. His Excellency the Rais is as great a dervish
as any mad fellow here, and though suffering greatly
from headache and bad eyes, he endured this tomfoolery
for nearly a couple of hours. My taleb, a shrewd man,
said to me, "Don't you see, I told you this Algerian
was an impostor?" I believe really he is a French<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-298" id="V1-298"></a>[<a href="./images/1-298.png">298</a>]</span>
spy on the movements of the Turks, and perhaps
myself. The Tibboo calls. He is preparing to depart,
and presses me to go with him. Speaking to a Touarick,
he said, "See the money of the Christians (taking hold
of my black buttons)." Many people have half a mind
to believe my black buttons are money. The Tibboo
says, there are no watches in Soudan. People are content
to measure time by the sun's rising and setting.
Some merchants, lately come from Tunis, have heard of
the projected a&euml;rial machine. They have no difficulty
in believing that Christians travel in the air. They
think the Devil, being very clever, teaches Christians all
these things. The <i>Touatee</i> calls, and says, "You must
write something." "What?" I answer. "Oh," he replies,
"My wife has a head full of fantazia (or nonsense);
this you must write." It appears the Touatee has got a
scolding wife. Told the Rais about this funny incident,
who said, "Tell the <i>Touatee</i> to go home and pretend
he's going to take another wife, and then she'll soon
leave off pouting."</p>

<p><i>16th</i> and <i>17th.</i>&mdash;Continues cold. People say I improve
in Arabic. I ought, for I have enough of it.
What is odd, I begin to joke with the people. It will be
seen I have represented the Saharan people as mostly
gloomy, and suffering from the oppression of their Government.
Still there are times when they can force a
smile, or crack a joke. They carry the joke so far that
they have sometimes joked me about my fasting in Ramadan,
a very sacred subject for a Mussulman. Every
time I go into the streets, I meet with one or other with
whom I try to get up a joke, for it grieves me to see the
people suffer so much from bad government. After we<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-299" id="V1-299"></a>[<a href="./images/1-299.png">299</a>]</span>
come to satire, and with the help of the word <i>batel</i>,
"good-for-nothing," we manage to hit off somebody.
An Arab Sheikh came to us, one day, when we were
joking. I said, "Oh! here's the lion-heart, who ran
away from Emjessem for fear of the <i>Sh&acirc;nbah-B&#257;tel</i>."
The Arab, astounded, "Ya rajel (Oh man), I had nothing
to eat!" "Nor have we here," replied a merchant,
"you better go and hunt with the greyhounds of the
Touaricks. The Rais has taken away all our victuals."
The poor Arab went his way very queer and crestfallen.</p>

<p>Speaking to a Moor of The Sahara, I said, "The
Sahara is always healthy: look at these Touaricks, they
are the children of The Desert." He replied, "The
Sahara is the sea <i>on land</i>, and, like sea, is always more
healthy than cultivated spots of the earth. These Touaricks
are chiefly strong and powerful from drinking
camels' milk<a name="FNa_1-52" id="FNa_1-52"></a><a href="#FoN_1-52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>. They drink it for months together, often
for four or five months, not eating or drinking anything
else. After they have drank it some time, they have no
evacuations for four or five days, and these are as white
as my bornouse. It is the camels' milk which makes the
Touaricks like lions. A boy shoots up to manhood in
few years; and there's nothing in the world so nourishing
as camel's milk." Cailli&eacute; mentions that the chief of
the Braknas lived for several months on nothing but
milk; but it was cow's milk. Many of the Saharan
tribes are supported for six months out of twelve on
milk.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-300" id="V1-300"></a>[<a href="./images/1-300.png">300</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Moors seem to have a secret dislike for women, as
well as a most obstinate desire to tyrannize over them.
There is a lurking desire of this sort in the men-sex of
all countries. Are we not the Lords of Creation? I
actually get afraid of avowing to them that the supreme
ruler of England is <i>a woman</i>, they are so confoundedly
annoyed at the circumstance. The first questions of their
surprise are, "How? Why?" &amp;c. My taleb is very
fond of supporting the doctrine of a woman having only
a <i>fifth</i> of her father's property. I annoy him by telling
him it's a bad law, and that the daughter should have
an equal share with the son. Lady Morgan is sadly
wanted here; she would find ample additional materials
for a second edition of "Woman and her Master."</p>

<p><i>18th.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">With</span> the full moon the cold has regularly
set in. Good-bye flies and good-bye scorpions. Can
now write with my door open, without being covered
with flies. Can also sleep without waking up at midnight
to kill scorpions running over the mattresses.
The mad black dervish is always in motion, and full of
gaiety. People are so fond of him that they think he is
inspired. When all the Moors are in solemn vacant
thought, or brooding over their griefs, or dreaming in
broad day of their being marabouts or sultans, the poor
witless thing runs in amongst them, shaking hands with
the first he meets with, and bursts out a-laughing. He
usually succeeds in infusing a little of his cheerfulness
into these equally <i>mad</i> people, but more sober in their<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-302" id="V1-302"></a>[<a href="./images/1-302.png">302</a>]</span>
method of madness. Yesterday the slaves had another
feast <i>for the dead</i>. The Moors allow their slaves the
liberty of blending the two religions, as Rome has
allowed the blending of Christianity and paganism.
And when questioned about it they say; "Oh, the
slaves know only a little of Allah, and are not much
better than donkeys in their understandings." The slaves
assembled to the number of some fifty in the Souk.
Here they performed a species of walking dance, in two
right lines, very slow and very stiff and measured, having
attached to it some mysterious meaning. They were
gaily dressed, attended with a drum and iron castanets,
making melodious noises. Each had a matchlock slung
at his back. The women carried a chafing-dish of
incense, as if about to raise some spirit or ghost. A
crowd was around them; but they performed nothing
but this slow-marching dance, and then retired to the
tombs. The dervish, poor fellow, mingled in the gay
throng, shouldering a stick for a gun.</p>

<p>Received many little presents from people lately.
Sheikh Makouran brought me himself a small basket of
very fine dates. My taleb afterwards brought me some
<i>gharghoush</i>, or small cakes, made of flour, honey, sugar,
and milk. They are extremely pleasant eating and a
little <i>acid</i>, which adds greatly to their flavour. There
are but few things acid in this country; of sour things
there is an abundance.</p>

<p>Heard a great deal about the Foullans, Foulahs, and
Fellatahs, the predominant race in Soudan. <i>Foullan</i>
(&#8238;&#1601;&#1604;&#1617;&#1575;&#1606; &#1601;&#1604;&#1617;&#1575;&#1606;&#1610;&#1606; &#1601;&#1604;&#1617;&#1575;&#1606;&#1610;&#8236;) is the Soudanic term, <i>Fellatah</i>
the Bornouese, and <i>Foulah</i> what is used to denominate<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-303" id="V1-303"></a>[<a href="./images/1-303.png">303</a>]</span>
them among the Mandingoes. According to information
here, they were once the most miserable race of <i>Arab</i>
wanderers in The Desert. But at last they settled down
as neighbours to the Negroes, some 700 years since.
They continued to increase in numbers and importance,
abandoning tents and building villages and towns, and
intermixing with the Negroes, till about forty-five (and
others thirty-five) years ago, when they expanded their
ideas to conquest and renown. About this time they
made the conquest of Kanou, Succatou, and the other
large cities of Housa. Never a people rose to greater
fame and power. They were assisted, like the Saracens
before them, by religious fanaticism, and so far corresponded
with them, in extending the boundaries of Islamism.
They went on conquering and to conquer till within the
present year, when their power received some check by
the daring exploits of the Tibboo prince of Zinder, a
vassal of Bornou. This prince has taken from them a
few towns. The complexion of the ordinary Fullanee is
a deep olive, with pleasing features, not much Negro, and
long hair.</p>

<p>Negroes in Nigritia are known by the <i>Shoushoua</i>
(&#8238;&#1588;&#1608;&#1588;&#1608;&#1575;&#8236;), or scarifying. Generally in Negro countries,
which profess the Mohammedan religion, the <i>Shoushoua</i>
is abandoned as <i>haram</i> or prohibited. It is mostly the
sign of paganism. The operation is performed by a
sharp cutting instrument, and is never <i>effaced</i> from the
face during life. The annexed drawing presents the
<i>Shoushoua</i> of the Negroes of Tombo, near Jinnee, who
are pagans. Whenever the slaves see these marks they
know the country of the other slaves who bear them.
Formerly it could be ascertained whether a slave was<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-304" id="V1-304"></a>[<a href="./images/1-304.png">304</a>]</span>
born on the coast, or brought from the interior, by the
presence or absence of the <i>Shoushoua</i>. Now it cannot,
because the practice is discontinued in countries subject
to Moslem rule, whence slaves are sometimes brought.
In Ghadames a freed slave is called <i>m&acirc;touk</i> (&#8238;&#1605;&#1593;&#1578;&#1608;&#1602;&#8236;)
or <i>horr</i> (&#8238;&#1581;&#1585;&#1617;&#8236;). The terms <i>waseef</i> (&#8238;&#1608;&#1587;&#1610;&#1601;&#8236;) and sometimes
<i>mamlouk</i> (&#8238;&#1605;&#1605;&#1604;&#1608;&#1603;&#8236;) are employed for a single
slave, and <i>&acirc;beed</i> (&#8238;&#1593;&#1576;&#1610;&#1583;&#8236;) for many. The Arabic terms
&#8238;&#1602;&#1575;&#1610;&#1583; &#1575;&#1604;&#1608;&#1589;&#1601;&#1575;&#1606;&#8236; "the chief of slaves," are used to denote
the person who is responsible for the conduct of slaves,
or the "Sheikh of the slaves." The word <span class="smcap">Razzia</span>, which
the French are said to have invented, and which has
acquired such a <i>triste</i> celebrity by their butcheries of the
Arabs in Algeria, is derived from the same word as
designates a Slave-hunt (<i>ghazah</i>)<a name="FNa_1-53" id="FNa_1-53"></a><a href="#FoN_1-53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> amongst our Saharan
people. The verb is &#8238;&#1594;&#1614;&#1586;&#1614;&#1575;&#8236; <i>ghaza</i>, "petivit," which in the
second conjugation means, "expeditione bellica petivit
hostem," and the noun in use is &#8238;&#1594;&#1614;&#1586;&#1614;&#1575;&#1577;&#8236; <i>ghazah</i>, "expeditione
bellica." The Bornouese word to denote a slave-hunt,
as carried on by the Touaricks, is <span class="smcap">Din</span>, applied to
private kidnapping expeditions, and means, I think,<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-305" id="V1-305"></a>[<a href="./images/1-305.png">305</a>]</span>
simply "theft," showing that not by war, as captives, but
by "theft," "stealing," the "man-stealing" of the Apostle
Paul, are slaves generally procured in Central Africa. It
is only just that <i>razzia</i> and <i>ghazah</i>, the same words,
should be so closely allied in application to their different
actions. The French, to do the thing properly,
and in their usual style, should erect a monument upon
the "Place" of the city of Algiers, to the new invention
<span class="smcap">Razzia</span>, with its derivations from <i>ghazah</i>, "a slave-hunt."
A prize essay might also be proposed to the Oriental
Chair of Paris, and its various students, now looking for
distinction as interpreters in the land of <span class="smcap">Razzias</span> or
"butcheries," for the best derivation and historical
progress of the term <span class="smcap">Razzia</span>, as used by Christian and
civilized nations, in relation to infidel and Mohammedan
barbarians. At the bottom of the monument erected by
the French to the <span class="smcap">Demon Razzia</span>, may be appended the
following veracious words, copied from the late proclamation
of the Duc d'Aumale, on his assumption of the
high post of Governor-General of Algeria (<i>Moniteur
Alg&eacute;rien</i>, October 20, 1847):&mdash;"You have learned by
experience, O Mussulmans! how just and clement is the
Government of France." The Duke unpardonably forgets
to cite one of the last proofs of this just and clement
Government, the roasting of a tribe of Arabs, men, women
and children in the caverns of the Atlas! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Will
not the Lying Bulletin (native of France) be
proclaimed till doomsday?</p>

<p>This morning the merchants asked me why the
English did not drive out the French from Algeria.
They had often badgered me with this subject. I
thought it better to speak plainly at once, and for all.<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-306" id="V1-306"></a>[<a href="./images/1-306.png">306</a>]</span>
I began by asking, why should the English drive out the
French? and continued, "France and England are now
at peace. They don't wish to make war at all, and
England does not consider Algeria of such importance as
to go to war about it. England did not derive much
benefit from Algeria when Mussulmans ruled there;
besides the Algerines were always sea-robbers. The
English were obliged to go and chastise them several
times before the French captured their country. And
do not think, that if war did take place between England
and France, and the English should drive the French out
of Algeria, the country would therefore be given up to
the Sultan and the Mussulmans. The English might
wish to rule there themselves. Upon no account
wish for war in Algeria, for the miseries of the war
would chiefly fall upon you, Mussulmans." This completely
settled them, and exasperated them, as well it
might; they said no more. The Mussulmans always
have in their memories the conduct of the English when
they drove out the French from Egypt, and discussing
this kind of politics, it is quite natural.</p>

<p>Afterwards I heard a Souafee holding forth to another
group. His theme was, the Sh&acirc;nbah, Warklah, Touaricks,
Tugurt, Souf, and Ghadames, and it was evident
to him that besides the people now enumerated there
were no others in the world. A respectable Moor
observed at the time, "That Souafee is a rascal. He's
as great a robber as a Sh&acirc;nbah bandit. Mussulmans
are not like Christians. The Christians have but one
word, and are brothers. The Mussulmans have a thousand
and ten thousand words, they don't speak the truth,
and they are enemies to one another." The ingenuous<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-307" id="V1-307"></a>[<a href="./images/1-307.png">307</a>]</span>
Moor knew little of the history of Europe and America.
I did not disabuse him of his good opinion of us. He
was a Ben Wezeet, and complained that now the <i>N&#257;ther</i>
(&#8238;&#1606;&#1575;&#1592;&#1585;&#8236;), or native overseer of the city, and the Kady or
judge, and some of the richest merchants belonged to the
Ben Weleed, and added mournfully, with a sigh, "It was
not so in my father's time. But the world has changed,
and this is the new world."</p>

<p>In reading the Arabic Testament, I have noticed
several parallel customs or habits between The East and
North Africa. Take this:</p>

<p>"But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote
upon the ground." (John viii. 6.)</p>

<p>People of Ghadames are writing daily with their
fingers on the ground. They are also wont, with fancy
ornamental sticks, which they usually carry, to illustrate
their ideas on the sand or dust of the streets, by drawing
figures. In speaking with them on geography, they
sketch shapes of countries. They cast up all their ordinary
accounts by writing figures on the sand. They
have also certain games which they play by the use of
sand. Sand is their paper, their ledger, their boards of
account, their pavement, and their auxiliary in a thousand
things. It is said in the Gospels, that The Saviour
escaped to the mountains<a name="FNa_1-54" id="FNa_1-54"></a><a href="#FoN_1-54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>, either from the pressure of
the people, or from the persecutions of his enemies.
Persons are accustomed to escape to the mountains in
Barbary, more particularly in Morocco and Algeria;
but also in this country. Our Saviour, besides, gives the
same advice to his disciples: "Let them which are in<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-308" id="V1-308"></a>[<a href="./images/1-308.png">308</a>]</span>
Judea <i>flee to the mountains</i>." (Luke xxi. 21.) It has
always been difficult to apprehend fugitives in the mountains,
especially in ancient times, when a good police did
not exist. The conqueror has always had great difficulty,
and exposed his conquests to imminent risk, by pursuing
the conquered in mountainous districts. Such are the
instincts and habits of men in all ages. The Desert has,
besides, afforded an asylum to the fugitive and unfortunate,
as well as the persecuted. Our Saviour was wont
to retire to desert places. In this country, the discomfited
defenders of their country's liberties have invariably
escaped to The Sahara. How many times has Abd-el-Kader
escaped to the mountains of Rif, or the solitudes
of The Sahara? But it is unnecessary to pursue this
obvious idea farther, otherwise it also will escape to The
Mountains or The Desert.</p>

<p>The "five <i>barley</i> loaves," (John vi. 9,) reminds me of
the <i>barley</i> bread of these countries, more frequent than
any other sort of bread. Wheaten bread is rarely eaten
by the lower classes.</p>

<p>It is needless to cite all the passages of Scripture
where the people in the towns and villages are represented
as bringing out their sick of every kind and
description. (Matt. xiv. 14, 35, 36.) So it is in North
Africa. Whenever an European visits these countries
with any pretensions to medical skill, all the sick of the
place are brought out to him. When I see the sick daily
brought to me&mdash;as also when I was in The Mountains&mdash;I
cannot help thinking of those affecting pictures
of disease and misery which were providentially exhibited
to demonstrate the divine skill of the Great <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Physisian'">Physician</ins>
of mind and body.<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-309" id="V1-309"></a>[<a href="./images/1-309.png">309</a>]</span></p>

<p>Salt is procured in a few hours' journey beyond <i>Sidi
M&acirc;bed</i>, and is considered superior to that procured at
the <i>Salin&aelig;</i> of the coast. This Saharan salt is only
obtained after there has been some rain, the earth being
impregnated with it, and the water washing away the
earthy particles. It is gathered in the dry season.</p>

<p><i>19th.</i>&mdash;Amuse myself with Arabic reading and philological
studies. The mornings continue cool. Administer
now little medicine, for I have but little left.
Ordered an Arab to be bled by the old Moor, who
possesses a good lancet. The big hulking Arab proved
a greater coward than a child. How sickness unnerves
a man, the hardiest and strongest of men! I once took
a passage from Algeria to Marseilles in a French transport
of convalescents. There I saw the brave and brilliant
French troops cry and whine like children under the
influence of fever. When the old Moor had bled the
soldier, he said to me, "Where's the money?" This
shows that, though they rarely think of remunerating the
services of the Christian Tabeeb, they have a perfectly
clear conception of what is due to the labour and skill of
a doctor when the case refers to themselves. Some time
after, I went to the old Moor again, and asked him to
bleed another soldier attacked with fever. He refused
to bleed him, alleging that he must be paid. "He will
die," I said. "Let him die," returned the unfeeling old
blood-letter; "why do they bring soldiers here, we don't
want them?" This afternoon I visited the barrack, where
several Arab soldiers were laid up with the fever, which
they had caught at Emjessem. One was very bad. The
Arabs said to me, "You must give him money to buy
some bread, and a little meat to make some broth." I<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-310" id="V1-310"></a>[<a href="./images/1-310.png">310</a>]</span>
told them they must go the Rais; it was his business to
look after his troops. It is distressing to witness the
condition of these wretched Arabs. At different times I
have given them a little meat, and bread, and oil; but
now my stock of provisions is getting down, and the
communication between Tripoli and Ghadames is very
precarious. In the evening I saw the <i>N&#257;ther</i>, and said
to him&mdash;expecting he would mention it to the Rais, "See
that soldier lying on the stone-bench; he is sick, and has
nothing to eat."</p>

<p><i>The N&#257;ther.</i>&mdash;"Yes, he is ill."</p>

<p><i>I.</i>&mdash;"But he has nothing to eat; can't you get him
something to eat?"</p>

<p><i>The N&#257;ther,</i>&mdash;"Pooh, he must die."</p>

<p>The other Moors present laughed at my simplicity in
begging something to eat for a fever-worn, emaciated
wretch of a soldier. The matter of fact is, these poor
fellows are detested by the inhabitants, and starved to
death by the Government. The soldier had caught the
fever of Derge, whilst sent there on business, which is a
bad tertian fever, prevalent in some oases of The Sahara.</p>

<p>Lately, as my turjeman and Said, with several negroes,
were chatting, and saying people would have husbands
and wives in the next world, I asked, in the manner of
the Sadducees, "If a woman had three husbands in this
world, whose wife would she be in the next?" They all
answered, "<i>The wife of the last</i>." As some of the group
of these theologians and diviners of the future state were
negroes, I asked, "What <i>colour</i> will people be in the
next world?" They replied, "<i>All white</i>, and alike; and
not only will their skins be white, but all their clothing
will be <i>white</i>." White, indeed, is the favourite colour of<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-311" id="V1-311"></a>[<a href="./images/1-311.png">311</a>]</span>
Mussulmans; and a sooty-black Mohammedan negro will
set off his face with a white turban, as our Christian
niggers do their <i>japan</i> with a lily-white neckcloth. But
<i>white</i> is the colour of purity, of religion in North Africa
and The East, as in <i>Biblical</i>
times.&mdash;<ins class="grk" title="Greek: peribebl&ecirc;menous en himatiois leuchois">&#960;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#946;&#949;&#946;&#955;&#951;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#965;&#962; &#7952;&#957; &#7985;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#8055;&#959;&#953;&#962; &#955;&#949;&#965;&#967;&#959;&#8150;&#962;</ins>. (Rev. iv. 4.)</p>

<p><i>20th.</i>&mdash;Weather continues fine and cool. Less meat
to be had; nothing decided about the new levy of
money, except that the people will not or cannot pay.
The Sheikh Makouran tells me he is greatly in debt to
Messrs. Silva and Laby, and so are all Ghadamsee merchants.
The money now employed in commerce is
chiefly that of European and other merchants of Tripoli
and Tunis. "We have no money," says Makouran,
"we cannot pay any new levies. If Rais persists, he
must collect our money at the edge of the sword; and
this can't last, for we shall all soon die of hunger."
These continual complaints make me melancholy, and
added to my impatience "to be up and doing," make me
very peevish. O Dio! but such is the lot of man, to
suffer always, either in mind or body. Much annoyed
at my taleb for eating Said's dinner, even before my face.
These Moors, at least some of them, have neither honour
nor conscience. I suppose the taleb is pinching his belly
to pay his portion of the new contribution. To punish
the taleb, I give Said coffee before him, without asking
him to take any. I may observe, the Moors don't like
to see me treat the poor blacks and slaves as their
equals. I frequently give the negroes tea and coffee
before I serve them, to show I despise such distinctions,
although, perhaps, against propriety.</p>

<p>The taleb began boasting about Soudan, and he has<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-312" id="V1-312"></a>[<a href="./images/1-312.png">312</a>]</span>
much reason to boast of it, if we compare what Mohammedans
have there done with what Christians have done
on the Western Coast of Africa. He said, "There's no
<i>gomerick</i> (Custom-house), no oppression, for the people
are Mussulmans." Such were the reasons for their not
being oppressive. It is a great question how far a
country may be civilized, and in how short a time, without
actual conquest? Civilization has progressed in
Central Africa with the spread of Islamism. When it
reaches the point of Mahometan civilization it will stop.
The question with us is, "Whether we shall civilize the
Mohammedans, and so work on Central Africa, or reconquer
their conquests?" There appears very little
chance of civilizing Africa without arms and conquest.
Bornou, Soudan, and its numerous cities, Timbuctoo and
Jinnee, formerly all governed by the <i>Kohlan</i>&mdash;&#8238;&#1603;&#1581;&#1604;&#1575;&#1606;&#8236;,
or "blacks," are now governed by strangers, either Arabs
(pure) or Touaricks or Fullans. These are the present
most important kingdoms of the ancient Nigritia, and
include a population of some millions. I continue to
pursue my inquiries respecting the Fullans. All agree
in representing them as originally <i>Arab</i>, but now greatly
mixed, of very dark colour, some being nearly black,
others, and most of them, a dark brown and yellow red,
and some nearly white. The fortunes of the Fullans,
emerging filthily from the dregs and offscouring of The
Sahara, have become as great as the old Romans formerly
in Europe, but they will always have powerful
and vindictive rivals in the Touarghee and pure Arab
and Berber races. The Revd. Mr. Sch&ouml;n has given a
too unfavourable report of the Fullans, in his Notes and
Journal of the Niger Expedition, biassed against them in<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-313" id="V1-313"></a>[<a href="./images/1-313.png">313</a>]</span>
his Missionary zeal, simply because they are Mahometans.
It is true that the Fullans are great slave-dealers, but so
are nearly all the princes of Africa. The mild and
equitable administration of the kingdoms of Kanou,
Succatou, Kashna, and other immense centres of population,
as carried on by the Fullans, is notorious
throughout The Great Desert. No people of Nigritian
Africa has so profoundly excited my best sympathies
as the Fullanee races<a name="FNa_1-55" id="FNa_1-55"></a><a href="#FoN_1-55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>.</p>

<p>The Moors do not fondle and dandle their children on
their knees, as parents are accustomed in Europe; and
when grown up, the children appear as distant from
their parents as strangers. This arises from the absolute
authority assumed by parents over children during
their minority. I have often been angry to see some of
the lower people here teaching the children to call me
<i>Kafer</i> ("infidel") as a sort of religious duty, lest, I
imagine, the children should see at last that there is no
very great difference between a <i>Kafer</i> and a Moslemite.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-314" id="V1-314"></a>[<a href="./images/1-314.png">314</a>]</span></p>
<p>Was much amused this afternoon in seeing physic administered
to camels. The camel is made to lie down,
and its knee joints are tied round so that it cannot get
up. One person then seizes hold of the skin and cartilage
of the nose, and that of the under jaw, and wrests
with all his force the mouth wide open, whilst another
seizes hold of the tongue and pulls it over one side of
the mouth; this done, another pours the medicine down
the throat of the animal, and, when the mouth is too full,
they shut the jaws and rub and work the medicine down
its throat. The disease was the falling off of the hair;
and the medicine consisted of the stones of dates split
into pieces and mixed with dried herbs, simple hay or
grass herbs, powdered as small as snuff, the mixture
being made with water. People told me it would fatten
the camel as well as restore its hair. Camels frequently
have the mange, and then they are tarred over. For
unknown incomprehensible diseases, the Moors burn the
camel on the head with hot irons, and call this physic.
Men are treated in the same way, and the Moors are
very fond of these analogies between men and brutes.
What is good for a camel is good for a man, and what
is good for man is good for a camel. Whilst the camel
was being drugged, a Touarick came up and said,
"<i>Sal&#257;m &acirc;leikom</i>" to me. They always use this primitive
mode of salutation. When they swear oaths they also
say, "<i>Allah Akbar</i>," (God is Greatest!) the famous war-cry
of the Saracennic conquerors of olden times. They
are primitive in all their ideas and words; their manners
are equally stiff, and slow or courtly, "stately and dignified;"
they fully understand the doctrine that, "Great
bodies move slow."<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-315" id="V1-315"></a>[<a href="./images/1-315.png">315</a>]</span></p>

<p>A man is said sometimes not to be worth "a pinch of
snuff;" and yet a pinch of snuff will knock a man down,
as it knocked me down this evening. My value then
does not quite reach to a pinch of snuff standard. To
come to explanation: a merchant offered me a pinch of
snuff, and to please him, I took a large pinch, pushing a
portion of it up my nostrils. Immediately I fell dizzy and
sick, and in a short time, vomited violently. The people
stared at me with astonishment, and were terrified out
of their wits, and thought I was about to give up the
ghost. They never saw snuff before produce such terrible
effects. After some time, I got a little better and
returned home. This snuff was that from Souf, and
what people call <i>w&acirc;r</i> ("difficult"). I had been warned
of it, and therefore richly paid for my folly. Moreover,
it was a violation of my usual abstinence from this not
very elegant habit. The Souf snuff is extremely powerful;
it is constantly imported here, and for the satisfaction
of snuff-takers and snuff-taking tourists, I am bound
to inform them that they will find snuff much cheaper in
Ghadames than in Tripoli. People call snuff hot and
cold, according to its stimulating, irritating, and tickling
power. It is prohibited to drink wine and spirits
amongst Moslemites, but, nevertheless, many of them do
not fail to intoxicate themselves with everything besides
which comes in their way: they snuff most horribly all
the live-long day. In the season the Arabs drink their
<i>leghma</i>, and the Mahometan Negroes their <i>bouza</i>, the
Soudanic merchants chew their <i>ghour</i>, nuts, and <i>kouda</i>,
as our jolly tars their tobacco, and others munch the
<i>trona</i>. My taleb came to me to see if I were dead.
He had heard such a horrible report in the town. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-316" id="V1-316"></a>[<a href="./images/1-316.png">316</a>]</span>
embraced the opportunity of lecturing him upon the
absurdity of the prohibition from drinking wine, when
he and others intoxicated themselves with snuff. But
man will have <i>his</i> stimulant, and the tee-totaller, who
protests against all stimulants, seeks his in his tea and
coffee. There is no harm in this, and the question only
remains to seek as harmless a stimulant, as consistent
with health as possible. In justice to the Marabout city
of Ghadames, I must mention that some of the more
strict Mohammedans consider snuffing, as well as
smoking, prohibited by their religion, and opium
(&#8238;&#1593;&#1593;&#1610;&#1608;&#1606;&#8236;), and <i>keef</i>, an intoxicating herb, sometimes
called <i>takrounee</i>, &#8238;&#1578;&#1603;&#1585;&#1608;&#1606;&#1610;&#8236;, are not smoked in this place.
In general, few of the Moors of this place smoke at all.</p>

<p><i>21st.</i>&mdash;Weather fine, no rain. The merchants begin
to bake biscuits for their journey to Ghat, which looks
like preparation. My friend Abu Beker called and gave
me two letters written to him from Timbuctoo by his
brother, who is established there. Since my return, I
have given one of these letters to the Royal Asiatic
Society, and the other to the British Museum, considering
them a great curiosity, so long as this city shall
remain separated from us Europeans by such impassable
barriers.</p>

<p>The following is the translation of the letter presented
to the Royal Asiatic Society:&mdash;</p>

<p class="figcenter"><span class="smcap">Letter from a Brother in Timbuctoo to a Brother in Ghadames.</span></p>

<p>"From the poor servant of his Lord, Muhammad ben
Ali ben Talib, to our respected brethren, Abu Bekr and
Muhammad, and Abdallah, and Fatimah, and Ayshah,<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-317" id="V1-317"></a>[<a href="./images/1-317.png">317</a>]</span>
and our Aunt Aminah; God prosper their conditions,
Amen!</p>

<p>"After a thousand salutations and respects to you, and
the mercy of God, and his blessings on you, should you
indeed inquire concerning us, we are well, and you, please
God, are so likewise; and we desire no further favour
from God than the sight of your precious countenance;
may God unite us with you before long, for He is the
Hearer (of petitions)! As to this country there is in
it neither buying nor selling. By G&mdash;d, O my brother!
this day we are six months in Timbuctoo, and truly in
the whole time I have received but 15 mithcals. There
is not a single farthing (or kirat) in this town, nor commerce
at all, except in salt, &amp;c., (<i>some other commodities,
whose names I cannot discover</i>.) And our minds are in
continual fear here from the scarcity of the times. I am
desirous of going to Arawan, if we can find something to
sell there, when the people of Kiblah (<i>the South</i>) come;
but they are not yet arrived, up to the present moment,
and we do not think they will come. And thou, O my
brother, beware of sending us any thing! as in this
country there is no commerce, (neither buying nor
selling); and whatever has been sent us, we have
received for it neither far nor near. And truly, from the
day in which we entered Timbuctoo, we have given 600
louats (some measure) to the Touaricks and the Fullans.
But do you pray with us that we may be delivered from
this land; and we have no more news after the letter
which we have written to you. Convey our salutation
to our aunt and to our brothers, many thousand salutations;
and to Muhammad ben al Tayil, and his brother
and his sons, many thousand salutations; and to<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-318" id="V1-318"></a>[<a href="./images/1-318.png">318</a>]</span>
Muhammad Ibn Ibrahim Taraki, many thousand salutations.
Salute also the Hajj al Beshir, and his
brother the Hajj Yusuff, if he is arrived; and salute
also Hajj Abdallah. The people (caravan) of Touat
have not yet come to us. Our salutation to Al Mustafa
and his brother Abdal Cadir, and tell the Hajj al
Behir, for God's sake not to send us any thing. Of a
truth, we sincerely hope to fulfil your commissions, but
in this land there is neither buying nor selling. By
G&mdash;d, neither in Arawan nor in Timbuctoo, have we
seen any one who will buy of you for a mithcal, nor for
a kirat. Tell the Hajj al Beshir, the Sheikh has not yet
arrived. And of all the (&mdash;&mdash;?) I brought to Timbuctoo,
I have not sold a single thing, and I sent them back
to Arawan. Know, that there is no dealing here except
by cowries, and the cowrie is 3,500 to a mithcal. Convey
my salutation to the Hajj Abdal Kerim Ben Aun
Allah, and his brother Abdarrahman, and to their sons;
many thousand salutations, and say to them, For God's
sake take care how you send us any thing, for this land
is a vexation to us. May God not visit you with vexation,
and may he open to us a way of deliverance! And our
salutation to the Hajj Muhammad Sahh, if he is arrived,
and tell him not to forget us in the F&aacute;tihah (1st. chap.
of the Koran, used in prayer,) and in the prayer called
Salihah (the Beneficial.) And also to his son and to
his mother, many thousand salutations. And our salutation
to the Hajj Muhammad ben Ali, and his brother,
and their father, many thousand salutations. And salutation
to our cousin (the daughter of our uncle)
Miriam, many thousand salutations, and to our aunt
Sult&aacute;nah, and to her brothers, and to (some other<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-319" id="V1-319"></a>[<a href="./images/1-319.png">319</a>]</span>

And our salutation to our cousins (the children of our
uncle) and say to them, For God's sake do not forget
us in the F&aacute;tihah and the prayer Salihah, that God may
deliver us from this land; and the people ("or
caravan") of Touat are not yet come to us. O my
brethren! we anxiously and most earnestly do desire
news of you; the Lord give us news of your welfare
before long. And do thou, O my brother! send us some
cinnamon and some black pepper, and some grains of
&#8238;&#1580;&#1604;&#1575;&#1608;&#8236;. And when thou writest, give us all the news, and
take care not to leave your letter unclosed, for the
people here read it, and be sure to seal it. Salute the
inhabitants of our street, all of them, without exception,
each one by name.</p>

<p>"And so farewell: at the date of Rajab the 25th, in
the year 1246; and again farewell, from this poor
(servant of God,) and many thousand salutations, as
also from Ibrahim and from the Hajj al Mansur and
the Hajj al Mansur's son, who is still with him.
Farewell.</p>

<p>"(Postscript below.)&mdash;Convey our salutation to Hajj
Hamad, and tell him Muhammad ben Canab is doing
well, and he is in Arawan; and in like manner salute
from us his brother Ali.</p>

<p>"(2nd Postscript at the side.)&mdash;Salutation also to our
uncle, and say to him, that among the people of the
Sheikh (&#8238;&#1575;&#1607;&#1604; &#1575;&#1604;&#1588;&#1610;&#1582;&#8236;) we obtain nothing, except what the
Lord has brought us (a proverbial expression of the
Moors, signifying nothing at all.) So farewell!</p>

<p>Obs.&mdash;This letter is written within and without,
and on every fold of it. The advice to seal the letter
to prevent it from being "Grahamized" is curious. I
have seen a hundred letters in The Desert <i>un</i>sealed, and
it is only in case of suspicion, that the Saharan merchants
seal their letters. Such is their confidence in
each other's honour and good faith, that it is an insult
to seal a letter when put into the hands of a friend. It
would appear, from this letter, that some twenty years
ago the commerce of Timbuctoo was in the most languishing
deplorable state; but as far as I can judge,
from the present operations of the merchants in
Ghadames, the trade of Timbuctoo has in a measure
revived. The letter itself is a most admirable specimen
of the epistolary style of the Saharan Moors, and in this
respect alone is of considerable value.</p>

<p>When walking out this morning, an impudent young
dog came running after me and shouted, "There is no
God but God, and Mahomet is the Prophet of God;"
whilst another cried out, "You Kafer!" Judging it
necessary to put a stop to this, I gave each little imp for
his pains a hard rap of the head with my fly-flapper,
which greatly surprised them, and sent them off yelping.
Some of the boys, however, are very friendly, and come<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-321" id="V1-321"></a>[<a href="./images/1-321.png">321</a>]</span>
running after me and take hold of my hand. A day or
two afterwards these young rascals came running after
me again in the same way; but they were chased by an
adult Moor, who gave them a good thrashing.</p>

<p><i>22nd.</i>&mdash;Weather fine. Nothing new. Bought Said a
new pair of Morocco shoes, and made him happy for a
day or two. He begins to sulk about going amongst the
Touaricks. To my great joy, the <i>Shantah</i> from Tripoli
has arrived, bringing letters from Colonel Warrington,
and Mr. Francovich, which latter has remitted to me 125
mahboubs. Two Touaricks have also arrived from
Touat. The road is open. Rain has fallen in many
places of The Desert in copious showers, which has
buoyed up the hopes of the camel-graziers. Rumours of
fighting between the Sh&acirc;nbah and Touaricks are prevalent.</p>

<p>The Tibboo left during the night for Ghat&mdash;<span class="smcap">alone!</span>
riding on a single camel. His conduct has astonished
everybody. Some say "he's mad," and some say "he's
a bandit." He had with him a small quantity of light
goods, and about 300 dollars in cash. I asked the Rais
about him. He observed, "That Tibboo has no wit.
Many people die on the routes, the camels running away
whilst they sleep. What can he do alone!" I asked
the people, all of whom replied, "The Tibboo is a wonderful
fellow!" One said, "Ah, that's a man, Y&acirc;kob.
No Christian like the Tibboo." But another said,
"Without doubt he's a cut-throat, that is the reason he
goes alone. Even the Touaricks are afraid of him;
and when they brought him here he quarrelled with
them several times. Besides, a few days ago he was
going to knock down the toll-taker at the gate." After<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-322" id="V1-322"></a>[<a href="./images/1-322.png">322</a>]</span>
this display of personal daring, I shall never have a
contemptible idea of a Negro. The free, independent,
and enlightened gentleman slave-driver of Yankee Land,
armed with that symbol of order and good government,
the bowie-knife! would find his match in this his brother
Tibboo slave-driver. The Tibboo has done what no man
of this city would have dared to do, in undertaking a
journey of some twenty days over The Desert alone.
What is very extraordinary, he never travelled the route
but once before, that is, when he came here. They say
he will arrive at Ghat in twelve days. He took the
precaution of purchasing a good pair of horse-pistols
before he left. I may add, he arrived safe and sound
at Ghat.</p>

<p><i>23rd.</i>&mdash;This morning exceedingly cold. In going out,
a man said to me, "Where are you going this cold
morning?" People were all shivering, or wrapped up in
their burnouses. Said is attacked with ophthalmia. Received
a visit from an old Arab doctor. He says cattle
are attacked with the plague, as well as men. He wrote
me a receipt for the cure of <i>night</i>-blindness, which would
cure it in one night. He says, in the neighbouring
desert, towards the west, there is a small oasis of Arabs,
who are called <i>El-Hawamad</i>&mdash;&#8238;&#1575;&#1604;&#1581;&#1608;&#1605;&#1583;&#8236;&mdash;who are always
afflicted by night-blindness, which singular affection is
called by them <i>Juhur</i> (&#8238;&#1580;&#1615;&#1607;&#1615;&#1585;&#8236;). Mr. Jackson, in his Morocco,
calls this strange disease <i>butelleese</i>. The Arabs
of <i>El-Hawamad</i> see perfectly well in the day-time.
But I must mention, that I received an application for
medicine from a person who is affected with the same
strange kind of malady. The European physicians call
this disease <i>Nyctalopia</i> (<ins class="grk" title="Greek: Nyktal&ocirc;pia">&#925;&#965;&#954;&#964;&#945;&#955;&#969;&#960;&#953;&#945;</ins>). I recently myself<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-323" id="V1-323"></a>[<a href="./images/1-323.png">323</a>]</span>
met with a case in London. But what is equally extraordinary,
Captain Lyon (I think) mentions a case
which he met with in The Desert, of a person who could
see in the night-time but not in the day-time&mdash;a human
owl. We conversed about other diseases in Ghadames.
The principal, as before-mentioned, are ophthalmia and
diarrh&#339;a. There are two lepers; a few dropsical
people; and, occasionally, small-pox and syphilitic diseases.
There are, besides, various cutaneous affections.
Dogs are known to go mad amongst the Arabs, but not
very often. When mad, they are called <i>makloub</i>. The
remedy is, when they bite people, the hair of the mad
dog himself, rubbing it over the part bitten. Mussulmans
are fond of this antagonistic idea, of the bane and
the antidote being one and the same thing, for they preserve
the dead scorpions to be applied to the sting of
the living ones, and they aver it to be a certain cure.
Quackery is the native growth of the ingenious as well
as the whimsical and hypochondriacal ideas of men. In
dropsy the native doctors cut the body to let out the
water, as we do.</p>

<hr />

<p>Wrote letters to Mr. Alsager, Colonel Warrington,
and others. People grumbling about their letters being
too high charged. Formerly letters went free to Tripoli.
The Turkish post-office and policy never fail to make
things worse. Treating some Moors with coffee and
loaf-sugar, one asked me if there were blood in sugar, for
so he had heard from some Europeans in Tripoli. I told
him in loaf sugar. "What, the blood of pigs?" one
cried. "How do I know?" I rejoined; "if the refiner
has no bullock's blood, why not use that of pigs?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-324" id="V1-324"></a>[<a href="./images/1-324.png">324</a>]</span>
This frightened them all out of their senses. They will
not eat loaf-sugar again in a hurry. A most ludicrous
anecdote of the old Bashaw of Tripoli here occurs to me.
Old Yousef one day sent for Colonel Warrington, with a
message that the Consul's presence was very particularly
required. The Consul, putting on his best Consular
uniform, and taking with him his Vice-Consul, his Chancellor,
and his Dragoman, immediately waited upon His
Highness. The Consul found His Highness sitting in
full Divan, surrounded with all his high functionaries.
Approaching the Bashaw, the Consul was begged to take
a seat. His Highness then opened business, and, drawing
a very long and solemn face, requested to know,
"If the Christians were carrying away all the bones from
the country?" assuring the Consul that such he heard
was the case from his people, adding, that even the
graveyards were ransacked for bones. The Consul,
nothing blinking, or disquieted, congratulated His Highness
upon bringing such an important subject before
his notice, and observed, "It is very improper for the
Christians to be ransacking the tombs for old bones to
ship off for Europe." "Improper!" exclaimed the Bashaw,
"why the man who does so ought to be beheaded!"
"Yes, yes," replied the Consul, coaxingly, "he ought,
your Highness; I quite agree with you." The Bashaw
then got a little more calm, and begged of the Consul,
as a favour, to tell him what the Christians did with all
these old bones. The Consul, now assuming a magnificent
air, deigned to reply, "Now, your Highness, you
must be cool. You drink coffee?" "Yes." "You put
sugar in it?" "Yes" (impatiently). "You use white
sugar?" "Yes, yes," said the Bashaw, half amazed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-325" id="V1-325"></a>[<a href="./images/1-325.png">325</a>]</span>
half trembling, wondering what would come next.
"Then," cried the Consul triumphantly, "I beg most
submissively to inform your Highness, hoping that your
Highness will not be angry, but thank me for the information,
that the old bones are used to make white sugar
with." Hereupon was an awful explosion of <i>Allahs!</i>&mdash;beginning
with His Highness the Bashaw, and going
round the whole assembled Divan, in such serious and
perplexed conclave now met. Then followed <i>harams!</i>&mdash;in
the midst of which Colonel Warrington graciously and
elegantly backed himself out of the Divan, smiling and
bowing, bowing and smiling, to the utter horror of all
present. Next day His Highness made a proclamation
<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'forbiding'">forbidding</ins> any of his subjects from exporting old bones
on pain of death. On his part, the Consul issued a
notice calling upon all British subjects not to be such
barbarians as to violate the tombs of pious Mussulmans,
at the same time threatening them with the full
weight of the Consular displeasure. I am assured that
Yousef Bashaw never ate white sugar afterwards.</p>

<hr />

<p>The liberties which Colonel Warrington was wont to
take with old Yousef Bashaw, of the Caramanly dynasty,
could not now be, in these days of Ottoman politeness,
at all tolerated. For a long series of years, and especially
during the French war, the Colonel was the virtual
Bashaw of Tripoli. I shall only give another of a thousand
incidents in which the British Consul showed himself
the master, and the Bashaw the slave, instead of the
Sovereign of his own country. One day the Bashaw had
done something to offend the Consul. Colonel Warrington,
hearing of it whilst riding out, immediately rides off<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-326" id="V1-326"></a>[<a href="./images/1-326.png">326</a>]</span>
to the Castle, and rushes, whip in hand, into the presence
of the Bashaw, producing consternation through the
whole Court. An Italian, having at the time an audience
with His Highness, demanded, "<i>Che cosa vuole Signore
Consule?</i>" seeing the Consul frustrated in his rage for
want of an interpreter. "<i>Tell him</i> (the Bashaw) <i>he's a
rascal!</i>" roared the Consul, almost shaking his whip over
the head of His Highness. But the Italian was just as
far off, not knowing English, and fortunately could not
interpret this elegant compliment. The very next day,
the Consul and the Bashaw dined together at the British
Garden, the Colonel slapping the old gentleman over his
shoulder, and drinking wine with him, like two jolly
chums. In this way, Colonel Warrington managed to be,
what he was called in Malta, "<i>Bashaw of Tripoli</i>." Now
that Colonel Warrington, during the time these pages
have been going through the press, has left us for another
and a better world, we may for a moment compare his
Consular system with that which was pursued by the late
Mr. Hay, Consul-General of Morocco. The difference is
striking, if not remarkable. Colonel Warrington boasted
of being able to do anything and everything in Tripoli;
Mr. Hay boasted of being able to do nothing in Morocco.
The former had the Bashaw under his thumb, or hooked
by the nose; the latter stood at an awful distance from
the Shereefian Presence. Colonel Warrington underrated
the difficulties and dangers of travelling in Tripoli and
Central Africa, making the route from Tripoli to Bornou
as safe as the road from London to Paris; Mr. Hay,
exaggerating every obstacle, represented it as unsafe to
walk in the environs of Tangier, under its very walls, and
even boasted of himself being shot at in the interior of<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-327" id="V1-327"></a>[<a href="./images/1-327.png">327</a>]</span>
Morocco, on a Government mission, and whilst attended
by an escort of the Emperor's troops. With Colonel
Warrington, a mission of science or philanthropy had a
real chance of success; with Mr. Hay, no mission could
possibly succeed&mdash;failure was certain. And so I might
continue the opposite parallels. But in justice to these
late functionaries and their friends, I must observe, that
both were zealous servants of Government and their
country. They exerted themselves diligently and conscientiously
to protect and advance the interests of their
countrymen, who had relations with Tripoli or Morocco,
according to their peculiar temperaments and circumstances.
No doubt they gave Government at home an
immense deal of unnecessary trouble, and sometimes even
annoyance; but so long as each public functionary abroad
thinks the affairs of his own particular post of more
importance than those of anybody else, this inconvenience
will always happen, in a lesser or greater degree.</p>

<p>Said furnishes me with a continual anti-slavery text
against the slave-trade. Everybody asks me if Said is a
slave. I reply, "Slavery is a great sin amongst the
English. We cannot have slaves, or make slaves of our
fellow-creatures." Then follow discussions, in which I
damnify the traffick in human beings as much as possible.</p>

<p>Today witnessed a good specimen of Arab Desert
freedom. I was conversing quietly with the Governor,
seated beside him on his ottoman, a privilege granted
only to me, the Nather (<i>native</i> governor) and the Kady,
when rushed into the apartment a Souafee Arab, exclaiming
to the Rais, "How are you?" and seizing hold
of his hands, knocked his fly-flap down on the floor.
His Excellency was shocked at this rudeness, and I my<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-328" id="V1-328"></a>[<a href="./images/1-328.png">328</a>]</span>self
was a little startled. The conversation which followed,
if such it may be called, is characteristic of the
bold Arab, and the haughty Turk.</p>

<p><i>The Souafee.</i>&mdash;"The Sh&acirc;nbah are coming to Ghadames."</p>

<p><i>The Governor.</i>&mdash;"I don't know; God knows."</p>

<p><i>The Souafee.</i>&mdash;"My brothers write to me and tell
me so."</p>

<p><i>The Governor.</i>&mdash;"I don't know."</p>

<p><i>The Souafee.</i>&mdash;"Give me money, and I'll go and look
after them."</p>

<p><i>The Governor.</i>&mdash;"I have no money."</p>

<p><i>The Souafee.</i>&mdash;"Make haste, give me money."</p>

<p><i>The Governor.</i>&mdash;"Have none."</p>

<p><i>The Souafee.</i>&mdash;"Where's the money?"</p>

<p><i>The Governor.</i>&mdash;"Go to the Ghadamseeah."</p>

<p><i>The Souafee.</i>&mdash;"They tell me you have all their
money."</p>

<p><i>The Governor.</i>&mdash;"Go to them."</p>

<p><i>The Souafee.</i>&mdash;"I'm going, <i>Bislamah</i> (good bye.)"</p>

<p><i>The Governor.</i>&mdash;"Bislamah."</p>

<p>As the Souafee left the threshold of the apartment, his
Excellency turned to me, and raising his right hand underneath
his chin, drew its back jerkingly forwards, making
the sign of the well-known expression of contempt in
North Africa. He then said to me:&mdash;"See what a life I
lead, what insults I am obliged to put up with! what
beasts are these Arabs!" The Souafah are, indeed, the
type of the genuine Desert Arab. They have no foreign
master, and manage all their affairs by their own Sheikhs
and Kadys. The immense waste of sand lying between
Ghadames and Southern Tunis and Algeria, is their abso<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-329" id="V1-329"></a>[<a href="./images/1-329.png">329</a>]</span>lute
domain, in the arid and thirsty bosom of which are
planted, as marvels of nature, their oases of palms. The
Sh&acirc;nbah bandits, who plunder every body, and brave
heaven and earth, nevertheless dare not lay a finger on
them. I cannot better represent the feelings of the Souf
Arab, nor the "wild and burning range" of his country,
than by quoting the lines of Eliza Cook:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> 23rd, 24th, and 25th, employed in writing letters.
On one of these days the Rais called me to him and
asked, "Whether I really intended to go to Soudan, as
the people had reported to him?" I told him Yes, and
that I was already making preparations. His Excellency
affected great amazement, and looked exceedingly mysterious,
but did not know what to reply. At last he
observed, "I must write to Ahmed Effendi of The
Mountains, and if he says you may go, all well, if not,
you must not go." I then asked the Rais, what I was
to do in Ghadames? His Excellency said anxiously,
"Stay with me to keep me company. I am surrounded<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-331" id="V1-331"></a>[<a href="./images/1-331.png">331</a>]</span>
with barbarians. I am weary of my life here." As the
Rais spoke what I knew to be the truth, I pitied him
and said nothing, although I could not understand this
asking of permission from Ahmed Effendi, whom I knew
to be a queer customer to deal with. However, I interpreted
the sense of Colonel Warrington's letter to Rais,
viz., "If I had friends I might venture further into the
interior, if not, stay where I was until I made friends."
I believe the sympathy of the Rais <i>sincere</i>, which is a
great deal for a Turk, or even any body else in this
insincere and lying world. He is a timid man, and is
afraid the Touaricks will make an end of me. What
the Rais says is reasonable enough: "Bring me a Ghadamsee,
or a respectable Arab merchant whom I know,
and who will take you with him, and be answerable for
your head (safety), and will protect you equally with
himself, then I have no fears for your safety." I took
my friend Zale&acirc; to the Rais, who is a native of Seenawan,
and much respected by all. The camels of the giant
left to-day for Ghat, his giantship himself waits to be
conducteur of our caravan.</p>

<p>In replying to an observation about another increase
of taxes of which the people bitterly complained, I said,
"The Mahometan princes are now the greatest oppressors
of the people, whilst the Christian kings are more tolerant,
and people enjoyed more security under our Governments."
My taleb replied, "Yes, it is the truth, Y&acirc;kob,
and this is the reason. The Devil knows that all the
Christians, and Jews, and black <i>kafers</i>, belong to him.
So he troubles them not, they are his safe property and
sure possession. But he is always stirring up amongst
us Mussulmans evil passions, and leading our sovereigns<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-332" id="V1-332"></a>[<a href="./images/1-332.png">332</a>]</span>
to oppress the people, and one Mussulman to oppress
another." Such is the reasoning of a bigoted Moslemite,
and with him and others it has considerable force. Indeed,
a Christian stands a very poor chance with these
subtle orthodox doctors.</p>

<p><i>26th.</i>&mdash;The mornings grow colder and colder. I feel
the change sensitively, more so than the natives; am
exceedingly chilly. I perceive the hot weather has dried
up or torn off the flesh from my bones, and my feet are
very skinny. Attribute this a good deal to the water.
Rais is almost worn to a skeleton. This morning he
called his servants to attest, how stout he was when he
first came here. But as the heat is gone, I shall not now
drink so much water. The more malicious, in revenge
for Turkish oppression here, hope and pray the Rais will
die of the climate, and every Turk who succeeds him.</p>

<p>To-day the Touarick <i>women</i> leave for Ghat. No men
go with them, only some of their little sons. About ten
women form this caravan. They have camels to carry
their water, and ride on occasionally when they are
fatigued. I asked a Ghadamsee whether these women
were not afraid to go by themselves, particularly now
as banditti are reported to be in the routes. He replied,
"These Touarick women are a host of witches and she-devils.
No men will dare to touch them." This ghafalah
of women is a perfectly new idea to me. Some of
the women are quite young and pretty, and delicate,
and don't appear as if they could bear twenty days' desert-travelling.
One said to me, "If you will go with us women,
we will take better care of you than the men can do."</p>

<p><i>27th.</i>&mdash;Occupied in writing. Rais paid me a visit in
the afternoon. Gave one of the slaves who came with<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-333" id="V1-333"></a>[<a href="./images/1-333.png">333</a>]</span>
him a pill-box, which highly delighted the boy. I found
when I visited Rais again, that his Excellency himself
had become so enamoured with the pill-box, as to
purchase it from his slave. Said continues bad with
ophthalmia. The disease seems to attack mostly people
of this country, and not strangers. At any rate it would
seem that we require to be acclimated to catch these
diseases, as well as acclimated to resist them. Rais took
it into his head to preach to me about the decrees of
Heaven. "You and I," said his Excellency, "were great
fools to come to this country; I to leave Constantinople,
you to leave London. But it was the decree of God that
we should come to this horrible country." The decrees of
Heaven, or the acknowledgment of such, are the <i>bon&acirc;
fide</i> religion of Ghadames. "What do the people eat?"
I said to a man. He replied, "What is decreed!"
Another interposed, "Don't be afraid of the Touaricks;
you will not die before the time which is decreed by
Heaven for you to die." Such is consolation in man's
misery. Are we to believe this? or why not believe it?</p>

<p><i>28th</i>, <i>29th</i>, and <i>30th.</i>&mdash;Employed in preparing routes
of The Desert. This evening the Governor received a
letter from his spies in Souf, which reports that the
Sh&acirc;nbah had left their country four days before they
wrote, which is now fifteen days. It is not known
whether the banditti have taken the route to Ghat or
Ghadames. His Excellency has taken precautionary
measures, and sent soldiers to look out in the routes near
our city. He has also sent to bring back a merchant
who started yesterday to Touat, and another to Derge.
The freebooters are 100 horse, and 400 camels strong.
The Giant Touarick taking the alarm, and mounting his<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-334" id="V1-334"></a>[<a href="./images/1-334.png">334</a>]</span>
strongest and fleetest Maharee, has gone off to protect
his family and country. He was one of the expedition
last year, and slew a dozen Sh&acirc;nbah with his own hand.
In the meanwhile <i>caravaning</i> to all quarters is to be
stopped.</p>

<p><i>31st.</i>&mdash;Purchased an outfit for Said. Afterwards he
would put them on, and walked all over the town, and
left me to cook the dinner myself. I said nothing to
him, humouring his vanity. No people are so fond of
new and fine clothes as Negroes.</p>

<p><i>1st November.</i>&mdash;A strong wind blowing from the
south-east, or nearly east. Not very cold, clouds thick
and dark, and no sun. The music of the wind in the
date-palms is very agreeable, and tunes my soul to a
quiet sadness. The Ghadamsee merchant who was overtaken
on his road to Tourat, refuses to come back, and
says he trusts in God against the Sh&acirc;nbah. Some Souf
Arabs have come in to-day, giving out that the French
wish to assume the sovereignty over their country. The
able-bodied men of the united oases are calculated at
2,000.</p>

<p>Visited the gardens with my taleb as <i>cicerone</i>. Was
much gratified with the rural ramble, although there is
nothing remarkable to be seen. The three principal
productions are dates, of which there is a great variety,
some thirty or forty different sorts<a name="FNa_1-56" id="FNa_1-56"></a><a href="#FoN_1-56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>; barley and <i>ghusub</i><a name="FNa_1-57" id="FNa_1-57"></a><a href="#FoN_1-57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-335" id="V1-335"></a>[<a href="./images/1-335.png">335</a>]</span>
The ghusub is grown in the Autumn and the barley in
the Spring; in this way two crops of corn are reaped in
the year. A little wheat is now and then grown, but
does not thrive. The native date is the <i>madghou</i> (&#8238;&#1605;&#1583;&#1594;&#1608;&#8236;)
which is also common in Seenawan and Derge. It is
small and filbert-shaped, of a black colour, very pleasant
when fresh, but when dry very indifferent. I saw no
black dates in any other parts of The Sahara. The
gardens furnish besides a few vegetables and fruits, such
as pomegranates, apricots, peaches, almonds, olives,
melons, pumpkins, tomatas, onions, and peppers, a few
grape-trees and fig-trees in the choicest gardens, but all
in small quantities. There is scarcely a flower or fancy
tree but the <i>tout</i>. No person of my acquaintance, except
my turjeman, showed much fancy for botany. He had
brought an aloe from Tripoli, and planted it in his
garden. It is the only one. He has another tree or
two besides, which nobody else has. The merchants
have brought the varieties of the date-palm from the
different oases of The Sahara. Nearly every householder
has a garden, and some several. Sometimes a date
plantation is divided between two or three families, each
cultivating and gathering the fruits of his pet choice
palm. Herbage is grown in the gardens for fattening
the sheep. Pounded date-stones both fatten sheep and
camels. In summer the gardens are intolerable, but in
winter deliriously pleasant. Sheikh Makouran is the
largest landed-proprietor. He has seventeen gardens;
"nearly half the country," as a person observed. So
Europe is not the only place in the world where there is
such an unequal division of the land. The gardens are
small, and the whole number is some two hundred and odd,<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-336" id="V1-336"></a>[<a href="./images/1-336.png">336</a>]</span>
only the half of which are regularly watered from the Great
Spring. As the people can never depend upon rain, the
whole culture is conducted on irrigation. The Ghadamsee
garden-gate, of all the absurdities of inconvenience is the
greatest I ever met with. It is scarcely large enough for
a small sheep to enter. Every person entering a garden
must not only stoop but crawl through the gate. It is
fortunate there are no lusty people here, all being bony
and wiry like the Arabs. Not being dependant on rain,
the gardens only suffer from the locusts, and now and
then a blighting wind. In the Spring of this year these
insect marauders passed over the oasis and made a
pillage of the date blossoms for thirty days, besides doing
much damage to the barley. I encountered a flight of
the same horde, which emerged from The Desert and
then took to sea, and were scattered over to Malta and
Sicily by the wind, when I was travelling from Tunis to
the isle of Jerbah late in the Spring. From Ghadames
they proceeded <i>en masse</i> to Tripoli and Ghabs, inflicting
great damage. When they passed near the gardens of
Ghabs, the people climbed up the fruit-trees and made a
great noise, screaming and shouting, which kept them
from settling in masses on the fruit-trees and vegetables.
They also kindled a fire and tried to smoke them away.
Many of those which did settle were gathered, cooked,
and eaten with great <i>gusto</i> by the people. I met them
myself on the immense plains of Solyman; they were
the first flight of locusts I ever saw. I had seen locusts
on the hills near Mogador, where they are bred in great
numbers. Millions of small green things were just
starting into being. The locust is a somewhat disproportioned
insect, the wings are too fine for the bulk and<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-337" id="V1-337"></a>[<a href="./images/1-337.png">337</a>]</span>
weight of the body, which explains why they are unable
to struggle against the wind; as it is said in the Scriptures,
"and when it was morning the east wind brought
the locusts<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads ':'">.</ins>" (Exod. x. 13.) They do not fly high, and
when they settle on the ground they roll over very
clumsily. A flight at a distance looks like falling flakes
of snow in a snow-storm. They are mostly of a reddish
colour, with lead-coloured bodies, and some of a glaring
yellow. The yellow ones are said to be the males, and
are not so good eating as the others. The locust tastes
very much like a dry shrimp when roasted. They are
from an inch and a half to two and a half long. The
head is large and square, and very formidable. Hence
the Scripture allusion: "and on their heads were as it
were crowns like gold, and their faces were as the faces
of men." (Rev. ix. 7.) But the prophecy gives them a
superadded power which they do not possess, "and
unto them was given power as the scorpions of the earth
have power;" (v. 3.) for when you catch the locust
it makes little resistance and does not bite. Few of
these were eating, and most of them were either flying
or lay motionless basking in the sun, grouped in hundreds
round tufts of long coarse grass. My Moorish
fellow-travellers didn't like their appearance. They said
the locusts are bad things, and came from the hot
country to devour their harvest. It was indeed, an
unpleasant sight, this horde of insect marauders, and
soon lost the charm of novelty. But the world is made
up of the elements of destruction and reproduction.
Such is the eternal order of Providence, and we must
bear the evil and the good. I do not think that they
come far south or from the inner Desert, for they could<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-338" id="V1-338"></a>[<a href="./images/1-338.png">338</a>]</span>
not be bred in regions of desolation, where there is no
green thing. Yet these flights were from the south of
Ghadames, and at any rate they are bred in the Saharan
districts, from the banks of the Nile to the shores of the
Atlantic. The world is full of impostors. One of these
went once upon a time to Morocco, and endeavoured
to persuade the people he could destroy all the locusts
by some chemical process. I believe he was a French
adventurer.</p>

<p><i>2nd.</i>&mdash;Occupied in taking notes of routes. The whole
day overcast but no rain. Rais alternately laughs and
admires the Ghadamsee people. He was endeavouring
to prove to me what profound respect the bandits of The
Desert entertain for these Marabout people, and said,
"If a camel of the Ghadamseeah falls down in The
Desert and dies, and no person present has a camel to
lend them, they leave the goods or the load of the
camel on the high road until they fetch one. Should a
bandit pass by in the meanwhile and see the goods, and
recognize them to belong to an inhabitant of Ghadames,
he does not even touch them, but passes by and calls
for the blessing of Heaven upon the Holy City of The
Desert." This, one would say, is too good to be true, at
the same time, I have no doubt the banditti of The
Desert have a species of religious respect for these pacific-minded,
unresisting merchants. I took an opportunity of
asking Rais about the use and value of his charms. His
Excellency replied, "They are to protect me when exposed
to robbers like the Sh&acirc;nbah, or to other evils.
These charms will then render me great assistance." I
I have already said Rais is as big a ninny in these
superstitious matters as any of his Maraboutish subjects.<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-339" id="V1-339"></a>[<a href="./images/1-339.png">339</a>]</span></p>

<p><i>3rd.</i>&mdash;Am still in great doubt as to the route I shall
take for the interior. Every route has its separate advantages,
and separate dangers. In this perplexity what
can I do but wait the turn of events? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Another
overcast morning, as dull and foggy as Old England's
November. A perfect Thames-London fog. I was
accustomed to think that in the bright sky of an African
desert such a mass of cloud and haziness was impossible.
Still, though gloomy and drear, there is more boldness
and definiteness of outline than in England. After a
person has been living long under the bright skies of the
Mediterranean, he may mistake a clear winter's day on
Blackheath, as I have done, for a moonlight, owing to
the want of those sharp angles by which nature draws
her landscapes in Southern Europe. To-day the face of
the heavens has cast its shadows upon the countenance
of the population, for all is dull in business. Every one
is awaiting the result of the skirmishes between the
Touaricks and the Sh&acirc;nbah.</p>

<p><i>4th.</i>&mdash;A fine morning, and not very cold. No patients,
everybody apparently in health. My old friend
Berka, the liberated slave, is now occupied in turning or
digging, or hoeing up a whole garden of good size, about
two days and a half's labour, for which he will receive
one Tunisian piastre! (Seven pence English money.)
This is free labour. I am sure the slave labour, the
principal here, cannot be cheaper. The implements of
agriculture are few and simple in The Desert. Friend
Berka had but a small hoe, which is well described by
Cailli&eacute;, who saw it used near Jinnee, and indeed it seems
to be used throughout Central Africa. This hoe is about
a foot long, and eight inches broad; the handle, which is<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-340" id="V1-340"></a>[<a href="./images/1-340.png">340</a>]</span>
some sixteen inches in length, slants very much. With
this hoe they turn up the earth instead of the plough,
and prepare and open and shut the squares of irrigated
fields. For reaping they make use of a small sickle without
teeth. The caravans usually have a supply of
these sickles for cutting up Desert provender for the
camels. The use of the hoe requires constant stooping
to the ground and is consequently laborious, but the
Saharan fields are very limited, and are soon hoed up.
The smallness of space is compensated by a redundant
fertility, and double and even treble crops in the
course of the year. Passing by a group of gossipping
slaves to-day, one came running up to me and
said, "Buy me, buy me, and I will go with you to Ghat.
I shall only cost you 100 mahboubs." This is humiliating
enough, but those who offer their services for sale,
like hundreds in the metropolis of London, to write up a
bad cause and write down a good one, or to&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2half">"Make the worse appear</span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"With words cloth'd in reason's garb&mdash;"</span>
</div></div>

<p>certainly perform a greater act of degradation than these
poor debased bondsmen.</p>

<p>A few evenings ago intelligence arrived that a Souf
caravan of eight camels and five persons were seen about
a day and a half from this city, proceeding in the route
of Ghat. This gave rise to suspicions that the news
about the Sh&acirc;nbah and Touaricks was a hoax of the
Souafah, in order to frighten the people of Ghadames,
and allow them (the Souafah) to get first to the market
of Ghat, and buy slaves cheaper. So reason the mer<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-341" id="V1-341"></a>[<a href="./images/1-341.png">341</a>]</span>chants
with the usual jealousy of such people. Rais,
on receipt of the above, summoned his Divan, and it was
debated, "Whether the Souafah should not be brought in
here by force?" The question was decided in the affirmative,
and late at night, fourteen Arab soldiers, two
Arabs of Seenawan, intimately acquainted with the
routes, and an official of the Rais, went off to seize the
caravan. This bold measure may bring us unpleasant
consequences. First of all, the Governor has no right to
seize a caravan in a district where the Sultan, his master,
has no authority, decidedly neutral ground, especially a
caravan of strangers. Then the Souafah, in revenge,
may attack the caravans of Ghadames. Again, it is a
question whether the caravan will come in without fighting,
for the Souafah are tough men to deal with. It will
be a poor excuse for the Governor to plead before the
Pasha, that the caravan was guilty of this hoax, supposing
it so, and giving this as the reason for seizing the
peaceable caravan of an independent state. Indeed, who
shall decide that they gave false intelligence of the
Sh&acirc;nbah? And if they did, should this be the punishment
for spreading a false report? Many other disagreeable
thoughts occur. It is clear there is a violent
infraction of international law committed on our neighbour's
(the Touarick's) territory.</p>

<p>Talking with a gossip about the character of Moors,
and he saying they were "<i>friends of flous</i> (money,)" <i>i. e.</i>
mercenary, and adding that the Touattee was the best
fellow amongst them. Said, who was present, said to me,
"Yes, it is so, and because he is a black man." Said
often repeats to me, "In Soudan it will cost you nothing
to live; being a stranger, everybody will feed you in our<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-342" id="V1-342"></a>[<a href="./images/1-342.png">342</a>]</span>
country." Another free black took upon himself to ridicule
the constitution of the white man. "Ah," he cried,
"what is a white man! a poor weak creature; he can't
bear Soudan heat; he gets the fever, and dies. No, it is
the black man that is strong, strong always. He never
droops or sinks! Look at the strength of my limbs."
Such are the traits of character of coloured men in this
Saharan world. I add another anecdote. Speaking to
Berka one day, I said, "I shall have that Tibboo himself
sold as a slave; what right has he to bring people
here as slaves and sell them?" Berka mistook my meaning,
thinking that, because the Tibboo was black, I
wished to have him sold and punished, and not for being
a slave-dealer, and the old gentleman got into a great
passion, sharply reprimanding me in this style: "Yes,
Christian! drop that language; when you get to Soudan
you will find everybody black. Drop that language;
don't fancy, because the Tibboo is black, you can sell
him. Drop that language, for all are black there."</p>

<p><i>7th.</i>&mdash;This morning, after a pursuit of three days, our
soldiers brought in the Souf Arabs, which has made a
great clamour in the town, as it always happens in disputed
cases, the people arranging themselves on different
sides as partisans, some for the Rais and others for the
Souafah. Called upon the Governor and told him I hoped
he would not take the <i>gomerick</i> ("duties") for the goods
of the caravan, as the people were brought here against
their will. His Excellency said he would not, but merely
reprimand them for spreading false news. It appears
there is some slight evidence of a hoax, but nothing to
justify such a violent measure. The Governor wants to
make it out that they might have been Sh&acirc;nbah, when<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-343" id="V1-343"></a>[<a href="./images/1-343.png">343</a>]</span>
it was well known before their capture they were
Souafah.</p>

<p>Every part of the date-palm is turned to account.
The fibrous net-work, which surrounds the ends of the
branches where they attach themselves to the trunk,
is woven into very strong and tough ropes, with which
the legs of camels are tied, and horses picketed. The
very stones are split and pounded, to fatten all animals
here. The branches make baskets of every kind; the
dried leaves are burned, and the trunk builds the houses,
supplying all the beams and rafters. One day, on looking
up to some palm wood-work, the old men present said,
"How old do you think that wood is, Y&acirc;kob?" "I
can't tell," I replied. They observed, "That wood is
upwards of three hundred years old. Indeed, we can't
tell how long it has been there. Our grandfathers found
it there, and it looked just the same then as now." It
was large beams of the trunk of the tree, with platted
thin pieces of the boughs across them, forming a fantastic
zig-zag joice of wood ceiling. The fruit of the date-palm
supports man, in many oases, nine months out of twelve.
In Fezzan, all the domestic animals, including dogs, and
horses, and fowls, eat dates. Such are some of the
various and important uses to which this noble tree is
turned. The Saharan tribes, likewise, are wont to live
for several months of the year upon two other products,
viz., milk and gum. Milk I have mentioned as supporting
the Touaricks exclusively six or more months in the
year. Gum, also, in the Western Sahara, furnishes
tribes with an exclusive sustenance for many months.
Even the prickly-pear, or fruit of the cactus, will support
a Barbary village for three months. It is, there<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-344" id="V1-344"></a>[<a href="./images/1-344.png">344</a>]</span>fore,
not surprising the Irish peasant may live on potatoes
and milk the greater part of the year. The bead
on the date-stone is the part (vital) whence commences
germination, and sprouts the new shoots of the palm.
New shoots spring up all over the oases, but particularly
in those places where water is abundant, and
within and about the ducts of irrigation. These shoots
are collected for the new plantations, and the female
plants carefully separated from the males, and these
latter destroyed. Only a few male plants are kept for
impregnation.</p>

<p><i>8th.</i>&mdash;Warm this morning, the cold weather gone
apparently for a short time. No patients. The long-expected
ghafalah from Tripoli has arrived by the way
of Derge, avoiding the more dangerous route of Seenawan,
by which latter I came here. No mail. All the
people now in a hurry to be off to Ghat, as their goods
have arrived. I begin to feel extremely irritable and
irresolute at the prospect of the new unknown Desert
journey. The old bandit called, and asked, "Well, are
you going?" I answered, "Yes, very soon, but I must
first have a letter of permission from the Pasha of Tripoli,
so the Rais says, for the Pasha is greatly afraid
you Touaricks will cut my throat." "God! God! God!"
exclaimed the bandit; "I'll risk my head that you'll go
on safe to Ghat and Aheer. But, as for those villains,
the Touaricks of Timbuctoo, those, I'll grant you,
are cut-throats." As I was about to take leave of the
old brigand, I gave him a piastre, and said, "Now tell
me fairly, and as an honest man, what is the reason
that the Touaricks kill Christians, and why did they kill
the English officer who went to Timbuctoo?" "Stop,<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-345" id="V1-345"></a>[<a href="./images/1-345.png">345</a>]</span>
stop," the brigand replied, very pleased with the piastre,
"I'll tell you. There are three reasons. First (scratching
with his spear on the ground), the Christians will
not say that Mahomet is the prophet of God. Second
(again scratching with his spear on the ground), the
Christians are the brothers of Pharaoh, and have plenty
of money; we are poor, we kill you for your money.
Third (again scratching), you wish to take our country.
You have nearly all the world; you have robbed us of
Algeria, and Andalous. Why don't you stop in the sea,
where you are? We shall not come to you. We don't
like the sea." Seeing I could make nothing of the old
sinner, so cunning was he, I gave him a piece of sugar
for his little son, and he went away. I thought often
of the words which I had recently read in the Arabic,
"The time will come when those who kill you will think
that they render service to God," (John xvi. 2,) when
discussing so repeatedly this question of the killing of
Christians by the Touaricks with the Rais, with the people
of Ghadames, and with the Touaricks themselves.
But has this principle alone reference to the wild tribes
of The Sahara? Has it not had a pointed application
in all the authenticated annals of the world? Take our
own era. The Jew thought he did service to God by
killing those who confessed Christ. Then the Imperial
Roman, he immolated the Christian who worshipped not
the image of C&aelig;sar. Then the Roman Christian killed
the heretic Donatist, lighting up the flames of persecution
in this Africa. Then the Catholic killed the Protestant,
and deluged Europe with a sea of blood. Thus
in England we enacted our penal laws against
Catholics and Protestant Dissenters, some of which,<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-346" id="V1-346"></a>[<a href="./images/1-346.png">346</a>]</span>
to our shame, still exist on the statute book. What
a horrid heritage of murder for conscience' sake
has been transmitted to us in this nineteenth century?
And is the present fratricidal war in Switzerland unconnected
with this principle of blood and persecution! No;
and again, no! How, then, can we find fault with the
barbarians of the Great Desert? Nay, contrarily, those
who follow me through The Desert, will find the Saharan
Barbarians infinitely more tolerant than the mild, and
the gentle, and the polished, and the educated, and the
civilized, and the Christianized professors of religion in
our own great Europe!</p>

<p>This afternoon the first portion of the Ghadamsee
Soudanic caravan left for Ghat, consisting of about
twenty-five camels, and some ten merchants and traders.
This is merely a detachment. The larger portion of the
population went to see them off, and several families
were dressed in their best clothes, as on festas. It is the
usual custom on the departure and return of caravans.
Two or three mounted on saddled Maharees accompanied
the caravan a day's journey. I have many offers
of the people, as in The Mountains, to accompany me to
Ghat: a strange infatuation for such rigid Moslems as the
Ghadamseeah!</p>

<p>To-day I witnessed in my court-yard or <i>patio</i> a tremendous
struggle between an ant and a fly: both species
of insects are very numerous in Ghadames, and there
is a great number of various coloured ants. The ant
got hold of the muzzle of the fly, or its neck, and there
grasped it with as firm a grasp as it is possible to conceive
of one animal grasping another. In vain the fly
struggled and flapped its wings; over and over again<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-347" id="V1-347"></a>[<a href="./images/1-347.png">347</a>]</span>
the combatants rolled as these weak defences beat the
air: and yet they must have had great force in them,
for they flung over the ant, of a good size, some hundred
times. The struggle continued a full half hour. I once
or twice took them up on a piece of straw, but the ant
never let go its hold on the fly, and paid no attention to
me. At last, the fly was exhausted, and ceased to flap
its tiny wings. The sanguinary ant strangled the poor
silly fly, as some sharper strangles or ruins his poor
dupe. After death, the ant seemed busy at sucking its
blood. Satiated with this, the ant attempted to convey
the fly away, dead as it was, but thinking better of the
matter, the carcase was abandoned. I observed that the
combat went on in the midst of a thousand flies, but
alas! these rendered their fellow, in this his death-struggle,
against a common foe, no assistance. Such is
the way the tyrants of the earth succeed! They strike
down the friends of freedom one by one, and the people,
as silly as the flies, leave their champions to struggle
alone against the common oppressor of mankind, only
thinking of what they shall eat and drink, in which
fashion adorn themselves, and how they shall fill up
sufficiently the measure of their idle days of folly.</p>

<p>The whole phraseology of the Mediterranean is very
loose in the designation of persons and objects. The
Italians call every Mussulman <i>un Turco</i>, "a Turk." The
French of Algeria call every Mohammedan resident
amongst them "<i>un Arab</i>." So the Moors and Arabs
here call all people who are not Mussulmans <i>Ensara</i>,
&#8238;&#1575;&#1604;&#1575;&#1606;&#1589;&#1585;&#1575;&#8236;, "Christians," whether Pagans, Idolaters, or what
not. I was writing some information from the mouth of
a Moor, and got into a scrape. He told me there were<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-348" id="V1-348"></a>[<a href="./images/1-348.png">348</a>]</span>
plenty of <i>Ensara</i> in Soudan, and I thought these might
be Abyssinian Christians, until I reflected that it was
merely the ordinary denomination of those who are not
Moslemites.</p>

<p><i>9th.</i>&mdash;Slept very little during the past night; always
dreaming of Timbuctoo. The further an object is from
you the nearer it is to your thoughts. The morning
broke with a violent wind from the south-east, which is
exceedingly <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'diagreeable'">disagreeable</ins>. Rais continues very gracious,
and sends me constantly cakes, being a portion of what
he receives as presents from the people.</p>

<p>I omit a great deal about Souf politics, not being
anxious to worry the reader with French and Tuniseen
Saharan diplomacy. But a Souafee's notion of hospitality
is rather, I should think, rigid. I said to a
Souafee, whose acquaintance I have made, "I shall come
to your country, and write all about it."</p>

<p>"If you dare," he replied, "by G&mdash;d, the people will
immediately cut your throat."</p>

<p><i>I.</i>&mdash;"I will get an <i>amer</i> ('order') from the Bey of
Tunis, which will protect me."</p>

<p>"No, no," rejoined the Souafee, "the people will tear
the amer to pieces, and set the Bey, the French, and all
Christians, at defiance."</p>

<p>No doubt the Souafah, the most interesting Arabs of
all this region, are very fierce of their independence,
which explains their jealousy of the French, and their
determinedly withholding any mark of sovereignty, in
the way of tribute, from the Bey of Tunis. It appears,
however, two or three of the small districts have really
consented to pay a tribute to the French, an act of
decided usurpation on the part of France, as the Souf<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-349" id="V1-349"></a>[<a href="./images/1-349.png">349</a>]</span>
oases "formerly did acknowledge" the sovereignty of
Tunis. It is, nevertheless, a pleasing trait in the character
of the Souafah, that they have permitted some
thirty families of Jews to settle amongst them, a concession
not yet made by the Marabouts of Ghadames.</p>

<p>Within my couple of months' residence here, how
rapid has been the impoverishment of the country!
Everything gets worse and worse. Now, it is almost
impossible to get change for a Tunisian piastre. I've
been two days trying to get change, and have not yet
succeeded. The money in circulation is principally
Tunisian piastres; but since the Turks have come,
Turkish money also passes. There are, besides, a quantity
of Spanish dollars and five-franc pieces. Apparently,
all the money has left the country, or is <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'hidded'">hidden</ins> by the
people. A good deal, I have no doubt, has been hidden
within a few weeks. The Governor himself laments that
he changed a dollar yesterday for two karoubs (two
pence) less than its current value in Tripoli. His Excellency
is very low-spirited, and very sick. His Excellency
prays that the Pasha will allow him to return to Tripoli
a few months. Being a good man, the system of extortion
which he is obliged to put in practice to meet the
demands of the Pasha, makes his heart sick. His Excellency
assured me, that if the Souf Arabs had not lately
brought some money, with which they purchased slaves
for the markets of Algeria, there would have been no
money left in the country. The merchants say their
affairs must now be transacted in the way of barter, as
in Soudan. I am particular in noticing these things,
and the cause of the impoverishment of these unhappy
people, as showing the curse of the Turkish system on
the transactions of commerce.<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-350" id="V1-350"></a>[<a href="./images/1-350.png">350</a>]</span></p>

<p>My taleb wrote in my journal this splendid Arabic
proverb:</p>

<p class="figcenter">
&#1575;&#1604;&#1585;&#1580;&#1575;&#1604; &#1587;&#1606;&#1575;&#1583;&#1610;&#1602; &#1605;&#1594;&#1604;&#1602;&#1577; &#1608;&#1605;&#1601;&#1575;&#1578;&#1581;&#1607;&#1575; &#1575;&#1604;&#1578;&#1580;&#1585;&#1610;&#1576; &#1589;&#1583;&#1608;&#1585; &#1575;&#1604;&#1585;&#1580;&#1575;&#1604;

<p>"Men are locked-up boxes&mdash;experience opens them; the
bosom of man is a box of secrets."</p>

<p><i>10th.</i>&mdash;To-day I ran about town to tire myself, in
order to sleep at nights. This morning, one of the two
expected ghafalahs of Tripoli, consisting of 117 camels
and twenty traders of Ghadames, arrived; the other
ghafalah will arrive in a few days. The ghafalah has
brought goods only for the interior. The merchants just
come report in town, "That Y&acirc;kob (myself) has written
to the English Consul of Tripoli, informing him how
<i>Aaron</i> (<i>Signor Silva</i>) lends money and goods to the
merchants of Ghadames, with which goods and money to
go into the interior, and traffick in slaves." This is substantially
correct; but it was written in confidence to
Colonel Warrington, and to no other person in Tripoli.
I expressly begged Colonel Warrington not to divulge
the fact, or my mention of such a matter, until I was out
of the lion's mouth of the slave-dealing interests of this
part of North Africa. The Consul, however, deemed it
his duty to disregard my request, and to divulge or
violate this confidence, and posted up a placard on the
door of the Tripoline Consulate, stating, "That certain
merchants, under British protection, were accused of
slave-dealing with the merchants of Ghadames, and calling
upon them to clear themselves from such an imputation."
Of course, as there was nobody else likely to<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-351" id="V1-351"></a>[<a href="./images/1-351.png">351</a>]</span>
make such an accusation but myself, being well known as
an anti-slavery man in Tripoli, the public attention was
at once directed to me as the accuser. The other merchant
alluded to is Mr. Laby (Levi), a Barbary Jew, and
the head of a house in Tripoli. Mr. Silva is also a Jew,
but from Europe. This report, circulating from mouth to
mouth, has created a tremendous sensation in Ghadames;
and the people fancy they see in it not only a blow aimed
at them and the slave-trade, but the final ruin of their
commerce, already sufficiently crippled by the oppression
of the Turks. I am, therefore, obliged to Colonel Warrington,
not so much for facilitating my progress in the
interior, as for increasing my difficulties a hundred-fold.
I was astonished that a high functionary, of thirty-three
years' experience in these countries, should have committed
such an act of egregious indiscretion, exposing
the life of a fellow countryman to such increased danger,
who was already without any kind of guaranteed protection.
If I had been murdered in The Desert tract
from Ghadames to Ghat, it would have most justly been
attributed to the placard placed on the doors of the
Consulate at Tripoli. Justice requires from me, however,
that I should state an indiscretion also on my part. I
wrote to the Consul that I had communicated the charge
against Messrs. Silva and Levi to the Secretary of the
British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society, and did not
add, as I ought perhaps to have done, that I had likewise
begged of Mr. Scoble not to make the charge public
for the present. Colonel Warrington was afraid the
charge would be known in London before he had reported
upon it, and in this way his Consulate might
suffer in the eyes of Government. Now I shall not<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-352" id="V1-352"></a>[<a href="./images/1-352.png">352</a>]</span>
trouble the reader with the proof of the charge. It must
already have been seen, that as the merchants of Ghadames
are drained of all their capital by the Turkish
Government, they, the merchants of Ghadames, are
obliged to fall back upon the merchants of Tripoli, who
will give them credit, some of which latter are under
British protection. So Sheikh Makouran complained
to me he could not now trade without the credit of Silva,
so the people told me the house of Ettanee, the other
great mercantile firm of this country, had received several
thousand dollars' worth of goods on credit from the
Messrs. Laby, and so the Rais frequently has told me,
the money of the merchants of Ghadames is in the
holding of those of Tripoli, who are mostly under European
protection. The question is, whether such a state
of things can be brought under the provision of Lord
Brougham's Act, for preventing British merchants from
trading in slaves, or aiding others to trade in slaves, in
foreign countries. It is a very delicate subject, because
the modes of evading the Act, by private and secret contracts,
are innumerable. British juries are also unwilling
to convict parties under this Act, and the case of
Zulueta failed not so much from the want of evidence
as from the unwillingness of the jury to come to an
impartial decision on the evidence.</p>

<p>Whilst reflecting upon my very critical position, my
poor Said came in from the streets very much cast down,
and very sulky.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh!" blubbered Said, "the people are all talking
about your telling the Consul that the Jews lend them
goods to trade in slaves. They hate you now."<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-353" id="V1-353"></a>[<a href="./images/1-353.png">353</a>]</span></p>

<p>"Never mind," I returned, "it will pass away soon."</p>

<p>Said had already become a staunch abolitionist, both
from principle and circumstances, and often asked me,
"When the English would put down the slave-trade in
Tripoli?" Said is by no means so stupid as I first
took him to be. I immediately determined not to go
out for two or three days until the excitement had
somewhat abated. In the evening I had many visitors,
who all spoke of my accusation against Levi and Silva.
I met the accusations by a deprecatory proposal of this
kind: "Would the Ghadamsee merchants consent to
abandon the traffic in slaves, on the conditions that some
English merchants would furnish them with goods on
credit at a lower rate than that which they obtained them
from Levi and Silva: if so, I would write about it to the
Consul? And, likewise, I would ask the Consul to get
their Soudan goods charged only five per cent. importation,
which was the sum paid for European goods coming
into Tripoli; thereby equalizing the per centage of the
imports and exports." My merchant friends received
this proposal very favourably, and swore there was no
profit in slaves, and declared themselves ready to give up
the traffic. Some proposed that they should try the gold
trade of Timbuctoo, and leave the Soudan trade altogether.
The traffic to Soudan is two-thirds in slaves or
more. I knew, however, that to expect such a thing
from the Turks, was all but hopeless,&mdash;their grand maxim
of Government being to depress and to destroy, not to
help and build up,&mdash;and I made to them the proposition
chiefly with the object of diverting the odium of the
accusation from myself. But yet, who does not see that
the proposal is well worthy the attention of any Govern<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-354" id="V1-354"></a>[<a href="./images/1-354.png">354</a>]</span>ment
that wishes to establish in Africa a legitimate commerce,
a system of trade which a good man and a good
Government may approve of and support?</p>

<p>Sixty Arab soldiers came yesterday from The Mountains
to protect the people whilst they are building the
caravansary of Emjessem. A merchant made a present
to-day of some slave neck-irons and leg-irons to the
Rais. His Excellency said to me, "I had none before,
it was necessary to have some of these things, in case
they should be wanted for the banditti who might be
captured." A person justly observed, "Before the <i>Truk</i>
(Turks) we had no need of these things, except for runaway
slaves, and we seldom used them." The Irishman
who discovered himself to be in a civilized country from
the erection of a gallows, might have equally proved the
advance of civilization in The Sahara from this fact.</p>

<p><i>11th.</i>&mdash;Feel greatly discomposed on account of the
news which has transpired respecting the joint dealings
of Silva and Levi with our Ghadamsee merchants. One
trouble succeeds another, as the angry waves beating on
the rocky shore. First the pain of delay, then sickness,
now other matters, then the prospect of a dangerous
journey through The Desert, with a people who may look
upon me with dislike, distrust, and every kind of suspicion.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In
the past night, blew a gale from the
north-west. Slept very little. Also troubled with a
large boil. Received a visit from some of my old Arab
friends of the Rujban Mountains, who regaled themselves
with bread and dates. Called on the Rais, who was as
friendly as ever. If his Excellency have heard the
report, he has the delicacy to say nothing about it. His
Excellency told me he had dispatched ninety-two <i>shatahs</i>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-355" id="V1-355"></a>[<a href="./images/1-355.png">355</a>]</span>
or mails, during the fifteen months which he has been in
Ghadames. It is reported in town, that Signor Silva is
in a great fright, and fears being arrested by the British
Consul at the order of the Queen. A notary visited me
to-day, laughed at the news of Silva, and was very
friendly; he protested the people got nothing by slave-dealing.
Begin to feel relieved, but I see clearly some
discouraging circumstances. My taleb comes in as usual,
but the turjeman is frightened and keeps away. Several
of the merchants positively affirm, that now, since the
market of Tunis is shut, and the Pasha takes ten dollars
duty on each slave, there is no profit in slave-dealing.
However, news has arrived from Ghat that a great many
slaves are coming with the next caravan from Soudan.</p>

<p>This evening was glad to go with the Rais to see the
ruins of <i>Kesar-El-Ensara</i>, &#8238;&#1602;&#1589;&#1585; &#1575;&#1604;&#1575;&#1606;&#1589;&#1585;&#1575;&#8236;, "The Castle of
the Christians," although I had seen them often before. It
was a great relief to me. The Rais put his head down
to the vaults under the ruins to listen to the conversation
of the <i>Jenoun</i>, or "Demons." His Excellency said he
thought he heard the Demons talking. The ruins are
situate about half a mile from the walls of the city S.SW.
All the piles have a small vault under them, apparently for
water, but it might have been an excavated tomb. The
people pretend that these ruins are four thousand years
of age. A son of the late Yousef Bashaw, on a visit to
Ghadames, about thirty years ago, to amuse himself and
frighten the demons, blew up a large portion of the
ruins with gunpowder. Previously the ruins were much
more perfect and imposing. I have made a sketch of
what remains of these ancient buildings. The style of
the buildings can be easily distinguished from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-356" id="V1-356"></a>[<a href="./images/1-356.png">356</a>]</span>
modern by its being composed of a very white cement
and small stones, half the size of ordinary paving stones,
the cement being in a large proportion. My turjeman
once pointed out to me a piece of the ancient walls of
the city, still remaining, exactly corresponding to these
ruins. I have seen frequent ruins of ancient Roman
walls, representing the same kind of building in North
Africa. This Kesar-El-Ensara, together with the bas-relief,
and the Latin inscription, copied by a Moor from
a tomb-stone, beginning with the words "<i>Diis Manibus</i>,"
are more than sufficient evidence to prove that Ghadames
was "colonized," as it was called, by the Romans, and
probably earlier by the Greeks and Carthaginians. The
same Moorish prince who blew up the ruins, carried
away also to Tripoli the tomb-stone, from which a Moor
copied the inscription, and which transcript I brought with
me from Ghadames. The copyist of this inscription
says, he affixed the Arabic letters in order that the
Mussulman might compare them with the Christian
letters and find out their sense, but he himself did not
know what were their meaning. On returning from
Kesar-El-Ensara, we looked around and were painfully
impressed with the appalling barrenness of The Sahara.
The Rais said, "Ah, these people, little know they what
a garden is my country compared to this!" The Rais
then stumbled over a small solitary herb and exclaimed
instinctively, <i>Hamdullah</i>, "Praise to God," picking it
up. What attracted our attention was the almost infinite
number of small serpentine camel-tracks, wriggling
endlessly through the wastes of The Sahara. The Rais
said, "Those Touaricks are incarnate Genii! they know
all these paths:" pointing south towards Ghat.<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-357" id="V1-357"></a>[<a href="./images/1-357.png">357</a>]</span></p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill1-14.jpg"><img src="./images/ill1-14_th.jpg" alt="Ancient Ruins of Ghadames" title="Ancient Ruins of Ghadames" /></a></p>

<p>Ghadames, &#8238;&#1594;&#1583;&#1575;&#1605;&#1587;&#8236;, is the ancient <i>Cydamus</i>, the
name being precisely the same. In the year 19 before
our era, it was subjugated by Cornelius Balbus, being at
that period in the possession of a people called Garamtes.
The Romans are said to have embellished it, and probably
built the fortifications whose ruins have been just
described. In an ancient itinerary, from Tunis to Ghadames,
we find the following names of stations, viz.,
Berezeos, Ausilincli, Agma, Augemmi, Tabalata, Thebelami
and Tillibari. Leo Africanus, gives the subjoined
account of Ghadames:</p>

<p><i>12th.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Slept</span> little during the night. Sorry I can't
read during the nights on account of my eyes. But
somewhat improved in health. Saw several merchants
who say nothing of the Levi and Silva business. I'm in
hopes this subject will not be agitated during the few
days I have to remain in Ghadames. The second ghafalah
has arrived but brings me nothing, not even the
medicines ordered from Tripoli. Patience! What can
be done? The Governor affected this evening to be
very indignant against the son of Yousef Bashaw for
destroying the ruins of Kesar-El-Ensarah. The Turks
are becoming antiquaries, and, perhaps, begin to see
the uselessness and folly of destroying ancient buildings<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-359" id="V1-359"></a>[<a href="./images/1-359.png">359</a>]</span>
for the sake of destroying them, even though they belong
to an infidel age. To their credit, the Moors themselves
are fond of antiquity in churches, and will patch up a
marabet or mosque as long as they can. The Rais, still
frightened, suggests that I should return to Tripoli. But
I cannot now, I will not. I ought not, for I have acted
over all the pains and perils of the journey to Soudan
many days and nights, and exhausted myself with expectations,
casualties, probabilities and conceivabilities,
&amp;c., &amp;c. I am now, in truth, suffering all sorts of maladies,
mental and bodily. Such is the wretched existence
we are doomed to sustain! And yet is not this our
mortal existence a still greater curse to the man, who
lives without an object and without an aim?</p>

<p><i>13th.</i>&mdash;Talk of heat and the burning desert, I had
last night an attack of cold, which I shall not forget to
the latest day of my life! My limbs all shrunk together,
my teeth chattered, and I did not know what pains
or disease was about to come upon me. This happened
whilst undressing. I immediately dressed myself in all
my thickest heaviest clothes, lay down, and in twenty
minutes happily recovered from the attack. But scarcely
slept all night, got a few winks of sleep this morning.
I attribute all this to the nervous agitation of advancing
into The Desert without a guide or friend, on whom I
can rely, combined with the severity of the season fast
setting in. Glad to see the sensation of the Silva business
dying away. People begin to laugh at me about
it, and call the Consul <i>Sheytan</i> for disclosing the purport
of a letter written confidentially to him. However,
I cannot conceive that Colonel Warrington was influenced
by any other feelings than those which resulted from<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-360" id="V1-360"></a>[<a href="./images/1-360.png">360</a>]</span>
a strict sense of duty. Apparently zealous in the performance
of his public avocations, he was determined to discharge
them at any cost, even at the sacrifice of the life of
a fellow-countryman. This is all I can now say about
the matter. Fortunately I was well known here, and
the people could not believe that it was from any ill-will
to them that I denounced the parties, which I hope the
reader will give me credit for; nor, indeed, could I have
any hostile feelings against the Tripoline merchants.
What I wish, and I imagine every friend of Africa does
the same, is to see a legitimate commerce established in
The Desert. It is curious to hear the Touatee. He
says he is sure I never wrote the letter at all, although I
tell him I did, and believes it an invention of people in
Tripoli. He won't believe his friend Y&acirc;kob would
breathe a syllable against the people of Ghadames.</p>

<p><i>14th.</i>&mdash;Slept very little during the night and cannot.
Am really reduced to very low disagreeable feelings.
Have an immense boil on my back, and another on my
arm, which I attribute to the effect of the climate on my
constitution, or to drinking Ghadames water.</p>

<p>News have come of the Sh&acirc;nbah having left their
sandy wilds on a free-booting expedition, leaving only
the old men, women, and children behind, for these
banditti propagate through all time a race of Saharan
robbers, the scourge of The Desert. Five weeks ago
they took their departure towards Ghat, and it is thought
they wish to intercept our caravan now leaving. Also a
skirmish has taken place between some Souafah banditti
and Arabs of Algeria. These banditti were routed,
leaving eighteen dead on the field and many camels.</p>

<p>An ostrich, caught at Seenawan, has been brought in<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-361" id="V1-361"></a>[<a href="./images/1-361.png">361</a>]</span>
here and presented to the Rais. His Excellency promised
to give him to me if I will return from Soudan
<i>vi&acirc;</i> Ghadames. He is a young bird and amuses us
much, running about the streets, picking up things in
character of scavenger. People are trying to make him
lie down at the word of command. "Kaed, (lie down),"
cries one, "Kaed," another; at length the stunned and
stupefied bird lies down.</p>

<p><i>16th.</i>&mdash;Occupied 13th, 14th, and 15th in writing
letters. Received a letter from Dr. Dickson, of Tripoli,
expressing friendly feelings. He has prepared some
more medicines, packed them up, and charged them to
me. Received a very friendly letter also from Colli, Sardinian
Consul at Tripoli. Mr. Colli is a fine classical
scholar, and the only consul I have met with in North
Africa who pays any attention to classical literature.
The late Mr. Hay of Tangier, had the reputation amongst
some people of being a classical scholar.</p>

<p>Continue unwell and in low spirits, or as the Negroes
say, am possessed by the <i>Boree</i> ("blue devils.") Days
are short, and nights tedious and painful to me, as I
cannot use my eyes by lamp-light, on account of a slight
continued ophthalmia. Nothing remarkable to-day. If
you want to feel alone in the world, which at times has
its advantages, go into The Desert.</p>

<p><i>17th.</i>&mdash;To my great satisfaction the mail arrived this
morning, bringing letters and newspapers. The Governor
is very friendly and is in better health. Quarrelled with
Ben Mousa, my taleb, for eating Said's dinner when I
was out of the way; to-day Said got him reconciled to
me. Haj Mansour's family consists of thirty-two persons,
all living in one house. This is the great <i>quasi</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-362" id="V1-362"></a>[<a href="./images/1-362.png">362</a>]</span>
negro-merchant before mentioned. His father died a
Saharan veteran of the age of one hundred and one. He
had been more than a hundred times over The Desert
trading. Yesterday died a man at the age of ninety-six.
There are several women now living more than eighty.
How long these poor creatures survive their feminine
charms! A woman in The Desert gets old after thirty.
I think, from what I have heard, people live to a great
age in this and other oases&mdash;if not to a good and happy
old age. Some remarkable cases of longevity in The
Desert have been narrated by Captain Riley. Said says
the people rob us desperately when they make our
bread. We usually buy the wheat and have it ground
and made into bread at the same time. I tell Said we
must expect this sort of pilfering where there are so
many hungry people.</p>

<p>My taleb began his interminable discussions on religion.
He said he had hoped that I should have recognized
Mahomet as the prophet of God, being acquainted
as I was with Arabic, the language of truth and unmatched
by any language in the world<a name="FNa_1-58" id="FNa_1-58"></a><a href="#FoN_1-58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>. I replied
language was not enough, other things were necessary;
besides, indeed, some of the Mussulman doctors had
said the Koran could be imitated and even excelled.
The taleb replied, "A lie! the doctors were heretics and
infidels, it is impossible to imitate the Koran's beautiful
language," citing the well-known words of Mahomet:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Answer.</i>&mdash;Bring therefore a chapter like unto it;<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-363" id="V1-363"></a>[<a href="./images/1-363.png">363</a>]</span>
and call whom you may to your assistance, besides God,
if ye speak the truth."&mdash;(Surat ii., entitled "Jonas.")</p>

<p>The taleb then turned to my turjeman, who was present,
and cited another passage, thinking I did not
understand what it was. The passage quoted was the
famous anathema of judicial blindness denounced against
infidels:&mdash;</p>

<p>"As to the unbelievers, it will be equal to them
whether thou admonish them, or do not admonish them;
they will not believe. God hath sealed up their hearts
and their hearing; a dimness covereth their sight, and
they shall suffer a grievous punishment."&mdash;(Surat ii.,
entitled "the Cow.")</p>

<p>This is evidently an imitation<a name="FNa_1-59" id="FNa_1-59"></a><a href="#FoN_1-59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> of our Scriptural passages,
of which there are several:</p>

<p>"Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet
unto our fathers, saying, Go unto this people and say,
Hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand, and
seeing ye shall see and not perceive. For the heart of
this people has waxed gross, and their ears are dull of
hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should
see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand
with their heart, and should be converted, and I<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-364" id="V1-364"></a>[<a href="./images/1-364.png">364</a>]</span>
should heal them."&mdash;(Acts xxviii. 25, 26, 27.) So we
have in John x. 26:&mdash;"But you believe not because you
are not of my sheep."</p>

<p>Besides these imitations, Mahomet has made differences
for the sake of differences. So the Sabbath of
the Moslemites is on the Friday, because that of the
Christians and Jews is on the Saturday and Sunday. I
taxed my taleb with his quotation. He did not flinch
or blink a hair of the eyelid, but said, "You Christians
cannot believe if you would, because God has blinded
your eyes and hardened your hearts." "Why do you
complain of us?" I remonstrated. "I do not complain,"
he rejoined, "it is all destined." I then related a story
of predestination which I had heard, of one man asking
another, "If all things were predestined?" and he
replying, "Yes;" the questioner immediately threw him
out of the window, saying, "Well, that is also predestined."
An old Moor sitting by, very attentively listening,
exclaimed immediately, "Well, even that throwing
out of the window, Y&acirc;kob, was also predestined." Said
then brought in some stewed meat. I gave my theological
disputants, reasoning&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Of Providence, foreknowledge, will and fate,</span>
<span class="ihalf">Fix'd fate, free will, foreknowledge absolute,</span>
<span class="ihalf">And found no end, in wandering mazes lost,"</span>
</div></div>

<p>some bread, and they began breaking it and dipping it
in the gravy of the meat, the invariable custom here.
Spoons they abominate, it is either their fingers, or
sopping. The Biblical reader will easily recognize the
custom. I took the Testament and read to the taleb
this passage:&mdash;"And," said Jesus, "He it is to whom I<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-365" id="V1-365"></a>[<a href="./images/1-365.png">365</a>]</span>
shall give a sop, when I have dipped it; and he took
a sop and gave it to Judas Simon Iscariot."&mdash;<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added missing parenthesis">(</ins>John
xiii. 26.)</p>

<p>The taleb was greatly delighted, and said, "Yes, so
it was in all times before the infidels introduced knives
and forks and spoons to eat with." I observed it was
much more cleanly to eat with knives and forks than
with one's fingers, but it was useless. He only replied,
"There's water always to wash your hands." The sop
mentioned in the passage cited might consist of a piece
of bread dipped into a dish of fat or broth. So all
Ghadames people eat, dipping pieces of bread, as they
break them from a loaf, into fat or broth, or other dishes
of this sort. We shall find, for what cause I cannot
tell, the Touaricks using spoons, and spoons which are
made in Central Africa, and distributed throughout The
Sahara amongst the Touarghee tribes. This little circumstance
would seem to be an argument against the
Oriental origin of the Touaricks, for, eternally dipping and
sopping, and sopping and dipping with the fingers, is coextensive
with the migrations of the Arabs and other tribes
from the East. Jews were the first to introduce knives
and forks into Mogador, because they have not the same
religious scruples on this head as Mohammedans. Barbary
Jews do it in imitation of their European brethren.
I shall trouble the reader with another display of the
sectarian zeal of my taleb.</p>

<p>To make a proposition, or a double proposition, of a
form of the orthodox Christian faith, I had constructed
the following, in imitation of the double proposition of
the Mahometans, (that is<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-366" id="V1-366"></a>[<a href="./images/1-366.png">366</a>]</span>&mdash;</p>

<p class="figcenter">&#8238;&#1604;&#1575; &#1604;&#1604;&#1607; &#1575;&#1604;&#1617;&#1575; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607; &#1608;&#1605;&#1581;&#1605;&#1617;&#1583; &#1585;&#1587;&#1608;&#1604; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607;&#8236;</p>
<p class="figcenter">"There is one God, and Mahomet is the prophet of God,")</p>
<p>&#8239;</p>
<p class="figcenter">&#8238;&#1604;&#1575; &#1604;&#1604;&#1607; &#1575;&#1604;&#1617;&#1575; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607; &#1608;&#1610;&#1587;&#1608;&#1593; &#1575;&#1576;&#1606; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607;&#8236;</p>
<p class="figcenter">"There is one God, and Jesus is the son of God."</p>

<p>The first proposition is seen to be the same; whilst the
divine nature of the Saviour, which is the distinguishing
feature of the Christian religion as looked upon by Mussulmans,
is added in the words &#8238;&#1575;&#1576;&#1606; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607;&#8236;. The number
of syllables is precisely the same, the &#8238;&#1608;&#8236; being merely considered
as the connecting link of the two propositions.
But the term &#8238;&#1593;&#1610;&#1587;&#1610;&#8236; would be much preferable to &#8238;&#1610;&#1587;&#1608;&#1593;&#8236;,
being the classic Arabic term. In teaching Christian doctrine
to Mussulmans, and, indeed, to all people, it is necessary
to adapt our style and language to their style and
language and mode of conception. The Catholics, however,
carried the adaptation too far when they turned the
statues of Jupiter and the Emperors into those of the
Apostles and Saints. For the Jews, the proposition could
be made thus:&mdash;</p>

<p class="figcenter">&#8238;&#1604;&#1575; &#1604;&#1604;&#1607; &#1575;&#1604;&#1617;&#1575; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607; &#1608;&#1610;&#1587;&#1608;&#1593; &#1607;&#1608; &#1575;&#1604;&#1605;&#1587;&#1610;&#1581;&#8236;</p>
<p class="figcenter">"There is one God, and Jesus is the Messiah;"</p>

<p>or as we find the proposition in the first verse of the
first chapter of St. Mark,</p>

<p class="figcenter">&#8238;[&#1604;&#1575; &#1604;&#1604;&#1607; &#1575;&#1604;&#1617;&#1575; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607;]  &#1608;&#1610;&#1587;&#1608;&#1593; &#1575;&#1604;&#1605;&#1587;&#1610;&#1581; &#1575;&#1576;&#1606; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607;&#8236;</p>
<p class="figcenter">"There is one God, and Jesus, the Messiah, is the Son of God."</p>

<p>This, being more full of doctrine, including both the divi<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-367" id="V1-367"></a>[<a href="./images/1-367.png">367</a>]</span>nity
and Messiahship of The Saviour, would, perhaps, be
the preferable form of the latter proposition. I showed the
taleb these propositions, and he was greatly exasperated,
adding it was blasphemy to connect Christian and Jewish
ideas with "the Word of God" (&#8238;&#1603;&#1604;&#1575;&#1605; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607;&#8236;). He added,
oddly enough, "Such impious things had never been
before done in this holy place, this sacred Ghadames."</p>

<p><i>18th.</i>&mdash;The Rais makes a last effort to persuade me
to return to The Mountains, and take the route of Fezzan,
adding as a reason, which tourists would very properly
consider an objection, "that I knew now the route to
The Mountains." I rejoined, "From what I have seen
of the people of Ghadames, and even the Touaricks, I
think I may trust them as well as the people of Tripoli."
<i>The Rais</i>: "Well, you are your own master;
the Pasha says you may go if you like. The Ghadamseeah
and Touaricks are one people; make friends with
them. But I'm sorry, after you have seen all my kindness
to you, my advice is nevertheless rejected." The
Rais now saw I was inexorable, and left off advising.</p>

<p>To-day some wild-ox, <i>bughar wahoush</i><a name="FNa_1-60" id="FNa_1-60"></a><a href="#FoN_1-60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>,&mdash;&#8238;&#1576;&#1602;&#1585; &#1608;&#1581;&#1608;&#1588;&#8236;
was brought in from The Desert. This is the hunting
time, which lasts three months, and the flesh of this
animal supplies a very good substitute for beef. Indeed,
the animal is a species of buffalo, but very small, sometimes
not much larger than a good-sized English sheep.
They are hunted in the sands to the north-west by Souf
Arabs, who are excellent hunters, and pursue the chase
twenty days together through the sandy regions. People
pretend the bughar wahoush does not drink; perhaps
they don't drink much. But both the wild ox and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-368" id="V1-368"></a>[<a href="./images/1-368.png">368</a>]</span>
aoudad are occasionally caught near the wells, a sufficient
proof they sometimes drink water. I cooked some, and
found it of excellent flavour. People call this animal
also medicine. I purchased half of one to salt for my
journey to Ghat, but spoilt it by too much salting. The
salt ate away all the flesh from the bones. I neglected
the advice of Said, who assured me people salt meat
very little in Soudan. Indeed, they frequently cut the
meat into strips and dry it in the sun without salting.
In this way caravans are provisioned over The Desert.
I ate some, and found it very good. My Arab friend,
the old doctor, brought me a small prickly shrub, which
he calls <i>El-Had</i>, &#8238;&#1575;&#1604;&#1581;&#1583;&#8236;, and says it has powerful purgative
qualities, purging even the camels. It abounds in The
Sahara.</p>

<p>We, The Desert Quack and English Quack, bandy
compliments together.</p>

<p><i>Desert Quack.</i>&mdash;"Whilst you are here, you are the
Sublime Doctor (Ettabeeb El&acirc;ttheem)." [As much as to
say, "When you are not here, I am The Sublime
Doctor."]</p>

<p><i>English Quack.</i>&mdash;"How? No, you are always The
Sublime Doctor. I am at your disposal. I am your
slave."</p>

<p><i>Desert Quack.</i>&mdash;"Impossible! Haram, it is prohibited.
You are the wise doctor, you know all things."</p>

<p><i>English Quack.</i>&mdash;"How many people have you killed
by your physic?"</p>

<p><i>Desert Quack</i> [surprised at this abrupt and impertinent
question].&mdash;"God forefend that I should kill any one!
But sometimes <i>Rubbee</i> (God) takes away my patients,
and sometimes they get better. But whether they die<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-369" id="V1-369"></a>[<a href="./images/1-369.png">369</a>]</span>
or live, people always say, 'It is written (predestined).'"</p>

<p>I then related the story of Gil Blas, who bled to
death the rich lady, under the precepts of Dr. San
Grado, and was challenged in mortal combat by the
suitor of the fair dame. On which he observed, "Gil
Blas was a dog. I trust the other man killed him.
Here we bleed, but we always know when blood enough
is left in a man to keep him alive."</p>

<p>"How do you know that?" I replied.</p>

<p><i>The Taleb.</i>&mdash;"1st. I see if he sinks down. 2nd. I
ask Rubbee. 3rd. Sometimes the Jenoun (demons) tell
me. 4th. If he dies, what matter? Is it not the will
of God?"</p>

<p><i>19th.</i>&mdash;Great preparations are now going on for the
departure of the ghafalah to Ghat and Soudan. An
order has come from the Pasha, that the Rais may take
2,500 instead of 3,250, less 750. This the people
must pay. And I hear the poor wretches have at last
consented to swallow the bitter pill. Every man, having
a small property, or a householder, will pay each five
mahboubs; the merchants considerably more. A little
by little, till the vitals of this once flourishing oasis are
torn out, and it becomes as dead as The Desert around
it.</p>

<p><i>20th.</i>&mdash;This morning a slave ghafalah arrives from
Ghat with forty slaves. Two escaped <i>en route</i>. What
could the poor creatures do in The Desert? They must
have perished very soon. The ghafalah brings important
news. The Sh&acirc;nbah, 700 strong, had been ravaging
the country of the Ghat Touaricks, and had murdered
thirty-seven people. The Touaricks were arming, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-370" id="V1-370"></a>[<a href="./images/1-370.png">370</a>]</span>
in pursuit of the Sh&acirc;nbah assassins. Besides this, the
Sh&acirc;nbah have captured a Ghadamsee ghafalah, escorted by
Touaricks, not respecting a jot the Maraboutish character
of this city. It consisted of thirty camels, laden mostly
with the property of our merchants. Sheikh Makouran
himself lost 2,000 mahboubs. Total loss for the merchants
here is about 15,000 dollars. It is the caravan
which left these two months ago, and took a letter for me
to the Governor of Ain Salah. Both letters have been
unlucky; the one sent to Ghat could not be delivered
because the Governor was changed; and this one, I
imagine, has fallen into the hands of the Sh&acirc;nbah.
Two slaves escaped with a water-skin. They then fell
in with some Touaricks, who gave them a little bread,
and in this dreadful plight they got to Ghat. One died
after his arrival. What became of the Touaricks is not
yet known. They are probably massacred. I made the
acquaintance of these luckless Touaricks, and gave them
some medicine to take to Touat. In this foray the
Sh&acirc;nbah killed a little child of three years old. When
they struck down a man, they ripped open his belly and left
him. These Sh&acirc;nbah banditti (who, to my surprise, are
lauded in the French works published by the Minister of
War, as the most enterprising camel-drivers and merchants
in The Sahara,) are, without doubt, what the
people say here, the vilest and most bloodthirsty miscreants
in The Desert. How strange it is they are
Arabs! It is always the Arab, who is the most
thorough-going, hereditary, eternal robber of The Desert!
Is it because we read, "And he will be a wild man; his
hand will be against every man, and every man's hand
against him?" The disposition for brigandage in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-371" id="V1-371"></a>[<a href="./images/1-371.png">371</a>]</span>
soul of the Arab was a proverb of Jewish antiquity.
So we have, &#8238;&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1459;&#1512;&#1464;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497; &#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1491;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;&#8236;, "As the Arabian in the Wilderness."
My Arabic translation, which was done by
the Missionaries of the Roman Church, follows some of
the ancient versions, and renders it &#8238;&#1605;&#1579;&#1604; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1617;&#1589;&#8236; "like the
thief in the Desert" (See Jeremiah iii. 2.) Still, Mr.
D'Israeli thinks there's nothing like Arab blood, if we
read aright his "Tancred," and would have us regenerate
the old effete race of Europe by this fiery and
bloodthirsty Oriental barbarian, as the Arabian stallion
improves our dull race of horses. It is reported, in
town, "When the Sh&acirc;nbah cut to pieces the thirty-seven
Touaricks, one man was left untouched amidst the
slaughter, owing his safety to his <i>Ajab</i>, &#8238;&#1593;&#1580;&#1576;&#8236; (amulets),
which he wore in great profusion." This lucky charm-clad
fellow saw the whole business from first to last,
unmoved amidst the commingled cries of the victims and
their slaughterers, and made a full report to the Touarghee
chiefs. Talking to Rais about this slaughter, his
Excellency observed, in the spirit of true Turkish policy,
"So much the better. Let the Touaricks and Sh&acirc;nbah
slaughter one another, as long as we are left unharmed.
The less of them the better for us." So the Turks have
always dealt with the quarrels of the Arab tribes in
Barbary, rather blowing up the flames of their discord
than pacifying them. The Sh&acirc;nbah drove away a thousand
camels, besides sheep and oxen, from the Touarick
districts. The merchants are all frightened enough, and
our departure is deferred, notwithstanding that the slave
caravan met with no accident. The Sh&acirc;nbah have now
got their booty and revenge, and will probably decamp<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-372" id="V1-372"></a>[<a href="./images/1-372.png">372</a>]</span>
and leave the route clear for us. Common misfortunes
often make friends of enemies. I saw Sheikh Makouran
and Mohammed Ben Mousa Ettanee, the two principal
merchants representing the factions of Weleed and
Wezeet, very busy in conversation upon the neutral ground
of the market-place, talking over their mutual losses.
Both have lost property to a great amount by this Sh&acirc;nbah
irruption.</p>

<p><i>21st.</i>&mdash;The departure of the ghafalah is deferred to
the 24th. Rais is busy in comparing the papers of the
merchants with the goods arrived from Tripoli. These
ill-used merchants pay 13 per cent. for exporting their
goods from Tripoli to the interior. The same goods
have already paid 5 per cent. when imported into
Tripoli by the European merchants. There is then the
profit of our Ghadamsee merchants, and the profit of
native merchants, and the merchants and the manufacturers
in Europe. At what price, then, above their
intrinsic value, are those goods sold to the merchants of
Central Africa? A hideous thing is this system of
transit duties!</p>

<p><i>22nd.</i>&mdash;Weather is cold, everybody wraps up. People
sit two or three hours together out of doors in the
morning before they'll stir. I ask them, "Why don't
you move about,&mdash;you would be then warm?" They
answer, "<i>M&#259;z&#257;l shemtz</i>" (no sun yet). Rais is excessively
gracious: he gave me a small loaf of white sugar.
I had none left, and the gift came in the nick of time
when required. I have said so much about Rais
Mustapha, that I must now give a personal description
of his Excellency, before I take leave of him and of
Ghadames. First of all, Rais is not a military man;<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-373" id="V1-373"></a>[<a href="./images/1-373.png">373</a>]</span>
he is a civil servant of the Porte, and receives his pay
direct from the Sultan. The Turks often employ a civil
servant where we should expect to see a military man,
as in this distant Saharan post, and find it to their
advantage. The Governor for military advice usually
writes to the Commandant of The Mountains. His Excellency
rarely reads, but writes constantly, and is very
expert in accounts, his principal occupation being the
collecting of small monies. His Excellency is also fond
of collecting coins of different Mussulman States. The
reader has seen that he is very attentive to his religious
duties, and is quite, if not superior "marabout odour." His
Excellency scarcely ever punishes anybody, beats his
slaves seldom, but can be very despotic when he pleases.
Like most Turks, he has a smack of bad faith in him,
and made the Souf Arabs pay the duty on the goods in
their possession, though he promised people he would
not. We may suppose he is very badly off for money;
perhaps his own salary is not very regularly paid. His
Excellency always behaved very well when I purchased
any corn of him. He is generally esteemed by the
people. In person the Rais is exceeding tall, above a
convenient height; he is about forty years of age, with
strongly-marked Turkish features, and a large aquiline
nose. His limbs are heavy and large, but since his residence
here he has lost all his flesh. He dresses in
the common dress of Ottoman functionaries. I often
found him chatty and facetious, but sometimes he was
sulky and morose, and would not speak for hours together.
He had a fine horse, but rarely could be prevailed
upon to go out and ride for his health. Every great
man has his shadow, his echo, the expression of himself<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-374" id="V1-374"></a>[<a href="./images/1-374.png">374</a>]</span>
more or less in his fellow men. The Rais's shadow is
one Abd Errahman, a small merchant. His sons call their
father <i>souwa-souwa</i> ("like-like") with the Rais. Abd
Errahman knew the Rais's most secret thoughts, and he
was the only Ghadamsee in whom the Rais could entirely
confide. Abd Errahman swore by the Governor's head,
and was his most obedient humble servant.</p>

<p>Sheikh Makouran is occupied in purchasing me an
outfit of Moorish costume for the The Desert. He is
very slow, but he gets them cheaper than if I bought
them myself. He purchases one thing one day, and
another thing the next day, and all from different persons.
This is the way here. Attempted myself to
purchase two turbans, one for myself and one for Said,
but I found it no easy matter. The owner asked three
dollars each, alleging that the turbans had been "blessed
at Mecca<a name="FNa_1-61" id="FNa_1-61"></a><a href="#FoN_1-61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>." I refused to give this price, and it was
agreed to wait till the Sheikh came. This was decided
by a council of the people, against the wish of the owner,
who objected to waiting. At length the Sheikh made
his appearance. Nothing was said about the price, for
every one knew they must abide by the Sheikh's decision.
The Sheikh after examining the turbans, said to
the seller, "Let them be sold for one dollar each." The
owner began to exclaim against this decision, but the
Sheikh stopped his mouth!&mdash;"This is our friend (<i>habeebna</i>).
Do you wish to rob him? Is this your kindness<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-375" id="V1-375"></a>[<a href="./images/1-375.png">375</a>]</span>
to a stranger, who has lived with us so long, and whom
we all love?" These words were uttered with the
greatest energy, and silenced every objection. I paid the
money, and a quarter of a dollar more for mine. Without
exception, the Sheikh was the most just and kindest
man I met with in Ghadames, and yet he had the reputation
of being close-fisted in money matters. He refused
to receive any rent for his house in which I lived, and
when I left he ordered a quantity of cakes to be made
for me, which he brought me himself. They were very
nice, made of butter, and honey, and dates, and lasted
me all the way to Ghat. Makouran pressed the Rais to
write for me to the Touarick authorities of Ghat; but his
Excellency could not without an order from Tripoli. I
am under very great obligations to the Sheikh, who
behaved like a father to me in a land of strangers. His
brother was kindness itself, but had not the spirit of the
Sheikh. His eldest son, Haj Besheer, was also a very
kind and upright young man. Haj Besheer has immense
influence with the Touaricks, and if he had gone with me
to Ghat, nothing would have happened. His principal
connexions are in Touat, and I really think that an
European, going with letters from him to one of his
Touarghee friends, might make the journey to Timbuctoo
in safety. Sheikh Makouran took me to-day before the
Rais and Kady, and in their presence a long "Testimonial"
of the people of Ghadames was drawn out in
Arabic, stating that during the time I had resided in
Ghadames I had conducted myself well, and given no
offence to any one. This was signed by the Kady, on
behalf of all the people, in presence of the Rais and
the Nather and several other officers. I was requested<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-376" id="V1-376"></a>[<a href="./images/1-376.png">376</a>]</span>
to countersign it, which I did with these words: "I have
remained three months in Ghadames, and now leave it
with great personal satisfaction to myself, and in peace
with all the inhabitants." A copy of this I made for
the Kady to keep in Ghadames. The "Testimonial"
itself was sent to Colonel Warrington, through the
Pasha, who either did not forward it to the Colonel, or
it has been mislaid or lost, for it cannot now be found in
the Consulate Archives. The people of Ghadames were
determined to give me this testimonial in order that the
Turkish authorities should not hereafter bring any accusation
against me. It was dated the 24th, or the day
fixed for departure.</p>

<p>The Rais astonished me to-day, by telling me, he had
bastinadoed twice my taleb, Ben Mousa, for dishonesty.
I absolutely thought the Rais was joking, for the Rais
and the taleb seemed always pretty good friends. I knew
Ben Mousa was not extremely delicate, and would sometimes
sit down with Said and eat his dinner away from
him. I inquired of the turjeman about it, who assured
me it was no joke, and that Ben Mousa had been twice
bastinadoed for borrowing things and not returning them.
I was extremely sorry to hear this, for I had been greatly
assisted by the taleb in obtaining information, and we
had passed many long hours together. The taleb is a
man of about fifty, extremely clever, and a pretty good
scholar, and had formerly kept a school. Now he did
nothing but calculate the water distribution or irrigation
of the gardens. He wished to come with me to England,
to work at translations and get a little fortune for his
family. But whenever I told him that there were very
learned Arabic scholars in England and France, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-377" id="V1-377"></a>[<a href="./images/1-377.png">377</a>]</span>
always answered, "They are concealed Moslems;" that
is to say, afraid to confess Mahomet before the Christians,
or seeking to convert Christians. From time to
time I gave the taleb a few presents and a little money,
as also the turjeman. This latter was a very different
character. He mended skin bags for water, made shoes,
white-washed houses, worked in the gardens, and made
himself generally useful. He had some property, and
his garden, the heritage of his ancestors, was one of the
finest in the country. He was honest, but his defect
was want of moral courage. The turjeman had lived a
good while in Tunis, with some French, where he learned
his Italian, and a few French words. He always said,
"When I lived with the Christians, I drank wine like
them." Some of the people, in a joke, would call him a
Christian. He was a bad scholar, and very bitter against
the Wahabites, whom he delighted to picture to himself
in the pleasing predicament of carrying the Jews to hellfire
on their backs. I myself one day had a quarrel with
a Wahabite. The Wahabite called me a kafer. I retorted,
"Why, what are you? You are nothing but a
Wahabite." He was so angry that he was about to draw
his knife at me, when the people seized hold of him, and
one of my friends knocked him down.</p>

<p>Rais heard of the affair, and said as he was a foreign
Arab he should leave the oasis. He came afterwards to
me to beg my pardon, and I gave him some coffee to
make him merry. He then told me all about the Wahabites,
not forgetting to abuse all the other sects. He
said the Arabs of his mountain had no objection to the
Turks if they would become Wahabites. He was also of
the Abadeeah, "white-caps," and declaimed against the<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-378" id="V1-378"></a>[<a href="./images/1-378.png">378</a>]</span>
"red"-capped Wahabites. The controversy is as nearly as
possible the same as that of our white and black-gowned
clergy of the Established Church, introduced by the
Puseyites.</p>

<p>Begin now to have some trouble with Said. He gets
sulky and saucy, and sometimes says he will stop in
Ghadames and eat dates. I am obliged to box his ears.
Then he gets very frightened at the Touaricks, and begins
to blubber, "I shall be made a slave again, and you yourself
will be killed." Then he would complain that the
Rais's servants and slaves had better clothes than himself.
I always found it was the better way to let him
have a <i>sfogo</i>, or "vent," for his temper, and afterwards
he was himself again. He never could keep a <i>para</i> in
his pocket, but would give his money to the first person
who would ask him for it. I am obliged to buy him
snuff every week, and a stock for the journey. With
this he is accustomed to treat everybody, and is therefore
very popular. Even the Governor thinks him the
best Negro he ever knew. As is natural enough, he is a
great favourite amongst the Negresses, and even amongst
the Touarick ladies. I found him crying one day, and
asked,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Said, what's the matter?"</p>

<p>"I now recollect my wife whom I left in Jerba," he
sighed out.</p>

<p>Before this, I didn't know he was married; he was
about thirty years of age. My turjeman and Said were
two great cronies, and they discussed all the town's
affairs in general, and everybody's affairs in particular.
At first, I had not the remotest idea Said had so much
wit, and was pleased to hear his remarks and criticisms.<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-379" id="V1-379"></a>[<a href="./images/1-379.png">379</a>]</span>
One of these was capital, and had a particular reference
to his own case. He stared at me, observing, "We
can't put the slave-trade down whilst the Jews in Tripoli
lend the merchants here goods to carry it on." He was
so fond of the turjeman that, on leaving Ghadames, he
gave him all the money he had, and said to me when I
scolded him, "We don't want any money in The Desert,"
adding, "Where are the shops?<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added missing quotation mark">"</ins></p>

<p><i>23rd.</i>&mdash;Bought a camel this morning, a <i>nagah</i>, &#8238;&#1606;&#1575;&#1602;&#1607;&#8236;,
or "she-camel," for 25 dollars. Rais would have the
honour of choosing the camel, but it was scarcely worth
the money. I hired another camel to carry a portion of
the baggage. Rais told me the Pasha had offered to
the Touaricks to equip an expedition, in conjunction
with them, against the Sh&acirc;nbah, but the Touaricks would
not accept of the aid, being determined to fight their
own battles in their own way. They might have
thought that after the Pasha had destroyed the
Sh&acirc;nbah, he would have turned his arms against them.</p>

<p><i>24th.</i>&mdash;We are all confusion in getting off. It is late
in the afternoon. I have loaded the nagah, and disposed
of my baggage; I have bid a hundred people
farewell, shaking them by the hands. We are surrounded
with the whole male population of the city, and
half-caste women. Rais is galloping about to see the
people off. But a group of people is now seen forming
rapidly round a man and a boy, and a camel just come
in from The Desert with a load of wood, "What's the
matter?" "The Sh&acirc;nbah! the Sh&acirc;nbah!" people
shout from detachment to detachment of the ghafalah.
The confusion of parting is succeeded by the terror and
rushing back of the people. The advanced party<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-380" id="V1-380"></a>[<a href="./images/1-380.png">380</a>]</span>
abruptly returns upon the party immediately behind it,
and all rush back to the gates of the city, one running
over the other<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads ','">.</ins> Rais appears amongst them to calm the
consternation. "What's the matter?" His Excellency
is too much agitated to answer the question. I find
Sheik Makouran. "What's the matter?" "The man
and the boy just come in saw twenty-five Sh&acirc;nbah
mounted on camels, and the ghafalah cannot go. Rais
is going to send out a scout, a <i>Senawanee</i>, to see if it be
the Sh&acirc;nbah, and then all the people are to arm and go
out against the robbers." A pretty kettle of fish,
thought I. The Governor then sent a man down to me,
to come and sleep for the night in his house. All the
merchants return, but the camels and a few men remain
outside, close by the gate. A number of soldiers are
sent round the city, and the <i>Senawanee</i> mounted on a
maharee, goes off in the direction where the Sh&acirc;nbah had
been seen, the Rais accompanying him a short distance.
On his return, the Rais bitterly complained of the merchants
not furnishing him immediately with camels.
It was some time before he could get the scout off. I
went up a mound outside of the city to see the scout "out
of sight." As the white form of the maharee was disappearing
in the glare of the sand, I admired the bravery
of the Senawanee, who thus defied single-handed a troop
of robbers, bearding them in their very ambush.</p>

<p>We waited with intense anxiety the return of the
scout. Many people got upon the walls to look out.
At length, at noon the 25th, a single camel was
descried on the dull red glare of the Saharan horizon.
This was the Senawanee. A number of people ran to
him. "Where are the Sh&acirc;nbah?" "Where?" "Sh&acirc;nbah?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-381" id="V1-381"></a>[<a href="./images/1-381.png">381</a>]</span>
The messenger said nothing&mdash;he was dumb. A crowd
gets round him&mdash;he's still dumb. He enters the Rais's
hall of conference, and squats down in the presence of
his Excellency. He speaks now, and calls for coffee.
The Rais gets furiously agitated at the moment of breaking
silence. The scout very calmly sips off his coffee,
and strokes down his beard, and then deigned to satisfy
Governor, Kady, officers, and the men, women, and
children, who were now pressing upon him with dreadful
agitation. "Oh, Bey! (raising himself from the floor,
fixing his eyes now on the Bey, and now on the people,
and putting his fore-finger of the right hand on the
thumb of the left)&mdash;I went to the sand. I got there
when the sun was gone down. The camel lay down,
and so did I lay down on the sand. We watched all
night. I fear no one but God!&mdash;(Here was a general
hum of approbation.)&mdash;Two hours before the <i>fidger</i>,
(break of day) I looked up and saw pass by me, at a
distance of from here to The Spring, nine <i>Bughar</i> (wild-bullocks).
They came and went, and went and came,
snuffing up the sand and bellowing. The man and the
boy, who cut the wood yesterday, saw the <i>Bughar</i>.
But the wild oxen are not the Sh&acirc;nbah!" As soon as he
mentioned the <i>Bughar</i>, the people rushing out of the
Bey's apartment, ran away, and before I could get my
dinner, a portion of the ghafalah was on the move.
The Rais said to me, "Get off, make haste&mdash;make
haste." I then went down to load the nagah again, but
found it very difficult; seeing the other camels passing
on, she would not stop to be laden. At length my
turjeman came and arranged all. Said observed that the
obstinacy of the nagah was a bad omen. His Excel<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-382" id="V1-382"></a>[<a href="./images/1-382.png">382</a>]</span>lency
the Governor came to see me off, and gave me an
affectionate shake of the hands. I then met his confidential
man Abd-Errahman, who said to me, "Rais has
given you in charge of all the people of the ghafalah,
(about sixty persons"). This was kind of the Governor,
and better, perhaps, than being in the charge of one
individual. But still I couldn't help thinking, that
what is many persons' business is nobody's business.
The turjeman accompanied us some distance, chatting
with Said. He carried with him a quantity of date-tree
fibrous netting, and was twisting bands as he followed
us. We soon parted. I then passed my old friend the
good-natured Arab doctor. His parting blessing spoke
the native goodness of his heart: "Day cool, route wide,
route Fezzan, ghafalah large, Sh&acirc;nbah there are none&mdash;God
bless you, farewell!"</p>

<p>I began to breathe at once the free air of the open
Desert. As is my wont, I now committed my spirit to
the care of God Almighty, leaving my body to the care of
the wild tribes of these inhospitable wastes. And why
not? Why distrust them? Have not the people hitherto
treated me with great and unexpected kindness? And
is it not the first step to make strangers your enemies, to
distrust them?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mounted</span> on my camel, pressing on through The
Desert, my thoughts still lag behind, and as I turn often
to look back upon The City of Merchants and Marabouts,
its palms being only now visible in the dingy red of the
setting sun, I endeavour to form a correct opinion of
its singular inhabitants. I see in them the mixture of
the religious and commercial character, blended in a
most extraordinary manner and degree, for here the possession
of wealth scarcely interferes with the highest
state of <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'asectic'">ascetic</ins> devotion. To a religious scrupulousness,
which is alarmed at a drop of medicine that is prohibited
falling upon their clothes, they add the most
enterprising and determined spirit of commercial enterprise,
plunging into The Desert, often in companies of
only two or three, when infested with bandits and cut-<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-384" id="V1-384"></a>[<a href="./images/1-384.png">384</a>]</span>throats,
their journies the meanwhile extending from the
shores of the Mediterranean to the banks of the Niger,
as low down to the Western Coast as Noufee and
Rabbah. But their resignation to the will of heaven is
without a parallel. No murmur escapes them under the
severest domestic affliction; whilst prayer is their daily
bread. Besides five times a day, they never omit the
extraordinary occasions. The aspirations of the older
and retired men continue all the live-long day; this
incense of the soul, rising before the altar of the Eternal,
is a fire which is never extinguished in Ghadames! Their
commercial habits naturally beget caution, if not fear.
In The Desert, though armed, they have no courage to
fight. Their arms are their mysterious playthings. Their
genius is pacific and to make peace&mdash;they are the peacemakers
of The Desert&mdash;and they always travel under
the intrepid escort of their warlike Touarick friends and
neighbours. Intelligent, instructed and industrious, they
are the greatest friends of civilization in North Africa
and the Great Desert. But upon such a people, falls as
a blast of lightning, rending and shivering the fairest
palm of the oasis, the curse of Turkish rule.</p>

<p>The force of our caravan consists of about eighty
people, including strangers, and two hundred laden
camels. Nearly all the people are armed, and some
single individuals have two or three matchlocks, besides
pistols and daggers. The character of the people are
petty traders, commission agents, camel-drivers, and
slaves. There are several Arabs, natives of Ghadames,
Seenawan, and Derge, and five strangers from Souf.
We have with us also three Touaricks. There may be
half-a-dozen low women and female slaves distributed<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-385" id="V1-385"></a>[<a href="./images/1-385.png">385</a>]</span>
amongst the ghafalah. Respectable females scarcely
ever travel in The Desert. I have only with me my
negro servant Said. My large trunk and tent are conveyed
by another camel; the nagah carries me, the provisions,
and the rest of the baggage, going extremely
well. Said walks with the servants, slaves, and camel-drivers.
Two-thirds of the people are on foot. Started
in tolerably good health and spirits, and increase my
appetite every mile I ride. Feel no fatigue, of course,
to-day, and trust I shall soon forget I'm travelling in
The Sahara. There are many routes from Ghadames to
Ghat, no less than four or five well-travelled desert
tracts. Our present one is the more easterly, being
skirted by the oasisian districts of Fezzan. None of
these routes have been travelled before by an European.
Our course to-day is directly east. We are now encamping
at sun-set, and we have just lost sight of the palms
of Ghadames. Alas! this will, I fear, be an everlasting
farewell to the beautiful oasis, and the holy city of
merchants.</p>

<p><i>26th.</i>&mdash;Rose before sunrise. Morning cool and refreshing.
We are to continue ten days in the route of
Fezzan, then turn into that of Ghat, thus describing
a sort of semicircle to get out of the forays of the
Sh&acirc;nbah.</p>

<p>Course south-east. On the right ranges of low dull
hills, with the same on the left, but at a greater distance.
The road very good, fit for carriages, through the broad
bed of a valley. Two great blocks of rock stand out on
the surface which we traverse, one an oblong square, the
other sugar-loaf, but flattened at the top.<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-386" id="V1-386"></a>[<a href="./images/1-386.png">386</a>]</span></p>

<p><i>Camel-drivers.</i>&mdash;"Look at these brothers" (the two
rocks.)</p>

<p><i>Myself.</i>&mdash;"How! Are these brothers? They are
not much like."</p>

<p><i>Camel-drivers.</i>&mdash;"Y&acirc;kob, don't you know that one
brother is born like the father, and the other like the
mother?"</p>

<p>These huge blocks we had long in view, and approached
and passed them just as a ship passes rocks on
the sea-coast. So steady is our progress, so level our
route. Ground strewn over with small flints and other
sharp chips of stone. Saw nothing alive in The Desert
but one solitary bird, which seemed lost in the illimitable
waste. Passed the grave of one who had died in open
desert, a small tumulus of stones marked the sad spot;
passed also a few white-bleached camel's bones. Very
cold, wind from north-east. Feel it more than the
keenest winter's blast of Old England. Feel glad I took
the advice of the Governor of Ghadames, and purchased
a quantity of warm woollen clothing, heik, bornouse,
and jibbah. "That route (Ghat) kills people with the
cold," his Excellency observed.</p>

<p><i>27th.</i>&mdash;Arrived at the well of Maseen, at 4 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>
Much the same scenery as yesterday. The road good,
not quite so stony as yesterday, and scattered over with
pieces of very fine quartz and shining felspar. No sand
in quantity, and a little herbage for camels. Wind as
yesterday, but more of it. Maseen is a tolerably deep
well, but the water is not very sweet. About it there
are three or four stunted date-palms, and several shrubby
sprouts, pointing the Saharan wayfarer to the well's site.<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-387" id="V1-387"></a>[<a href="./images/1-387.png">387</a>]</span>
One of the trees bore fruit this year, but the palm rarely
bears fruit in open desert. No bird or animal of any
sort seen to-day. The camels crop herbage <i>en route</i> as
usual. On the whole, however, we proceed pretty quickly.
I imagine about three miles the hour, for a man must
walk a sharp pace to keep up well with the camels.
Our people eat nothing in the morning; two or three,
perhaps, may eat a cake and a few dates. They literally
fast all day long and take their <i>one</i> meal at about seven
in the evening. I can't support this, and take tea in the
morning, besides munching dates at intervals through the
day. Nay, I feel ravenous, under the influence of the
bleak air of The Desert. About an hour before sunrise
all the people get up and make large fires, warming their
feet and legs, for these are mostly bare and are very
sensible to the cold. I'm sorry I've been obliged to
scold Said twice, once for running away from my camel
after other people's, and once for rough and saucy language.
But I must make the best of him; might easily
get a worse servant. Glad the eldest son of the Sheikh
Makouran has joined the caravan; he came riding after
us this evening, attended with a Touarick, both mounted
on maharees, well equipped and capable of scouring The
Desert.</p>

<p><i>28th.</i>&mdash;Some time before we got off this morning, on
account of the difficulty of watering the camels. My
nagah started off on the route of Fezzan about a mile
and a half, and Said went another way in search of her.
I was, therefore, obliged to fetch her myself, which was a
considerable run through a hilly region. I found her
alone wandering about. The she-camel strays more
than the male-camel, and is more restless. As soon as I<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-388" id="V1-388"></a>[<a href="./images/1-388.png">388</a>]</span>
called to her she stopped, stood stock-still, and looked
at me. Before the camels were all watered, the well of
Mazeen was nearly dry and the water muddy. This is
the reason large caravans have such difficulty in traversing
The Desert, it often requiring several days to
water a thousand camels. Here I recollected the justness
of Napoleon's observation cited by French writers,&mdash;"That
if Africa is to be invaded and conquered <i>vi&acirc;</i> The
Great Desert, it must be done by small detached parties."
For it is not that the wells do not afford a sufficiency
of water for large caravans, but that they do not yield
an immediate supply for numerous bodies, so as to
enable their people to march in one compact whole.
Here we were obliged to leave half the caravan, waiting
for the running of the water, thus miserably dividing
our strength in case of attack. Noticed one of the
camels laden with a bale of goods, on which were
European writing, viz., I. A. <span class="smcap">n.</span> 6. The great merchants
usually write the name of their firm under the designation
of <i>Oulad</i> (&#8238;&#1575;&#1608;&#1604;&#1575;&#1583;&#8236;) "sons," for example, <i>Oulad
Makouran</i>, "Sons of Makouran."</p>

<p>The advanced party, of which I was, unexpectedly
left the route of Fezzan to the east, and turned sharp
round to the south, through the gorge of a low mountain
range, which we had had all along to the right. In
this defile we proceeded an hour, but it had no natural
opening at the end. We came at last to a very abrupt
ascent of some hundred feet high, and mounted an elevated
plateau. Once on the plateau, all was plain as
far as the eye could see. The defile was tertiary formation,
mere dull crumbling limestone; nothing in the
shape and consistence of granite. We are now on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-389" id="V1-389"></a>[<a href="./images/1-389.png">389</a>]</span>
highway for Ghat, and it is said we shall arrive in fifteen
days from the plateau. Saw on the plateau, for the
first time of my life, the celebrated mirage, which our
people call <i>Watta</i>, but the classic Arabic is <i>Es-Sarab</i>
(&#8238;&#1575;&#1604;&#1587;&#1617;&#1585;&#1576;&#8236;). At first sight, I thought it was salt, for it
flamed in the sun white, like a salt-pit, or lagoon.
There appeared some low hills in the midst of the white
lake. As we proceeded, I saw what appeared like white
foam running from east to west, as the sea-surf chafing
the shore. It then occurred to me that this might be the
mirage; and so it turned out, for as we approached the
phenomenon, it retired and disappeared. The character
of the mirage was evidently affected by the wind, for the
foam appeared to run from east to west with the wind.
In some of the white flaming lakes, shrubs and reeds
stood out, as we find in shallow pools. Some high hills
appeared suspended in the air, veritable "castles in the
air." The weather was dull, the sun sometimes hidden,
and it was noon when the phenomena were most observable.
At Mazeen a few small birds were hopping and
chirping, and two large crows followed us upon the plateau;
also a butterfly and a few flies. These are the
living creatures noticed to-day.</p>

<p>The plateau, where I now write, is either covered with
very small stones, some quite black, and others calcined
or burnt, like brick-bats thrown from a kiln, or is altogether
hardened and black earthy soil. The latter
assists the mirage, for the phenomenon appears mostly
on the earthy tracts of ground. In some parts is herbage
for the camels. On the plateau we saw several small
mounds of soft brown stone, crumbling to earth, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-390" id="V1-390"></a>[<a href="./images/1-390.png">390</a>]</span>
looked like Arab hovels at a distance. I went up to
undeceive myself. These curious mounds have yet to
crumble away before the plateau is a perfect plane.
Course to-day mostly south, with a leaning to the west.
Wind cold S.E. and E. The day as dull and dreary
as in England. Our people occasionally mount the
maharees, which look very haughty and imposing. A
maharee would be a noble present for the Sultan of the
Touaricks to send to the Queen.</p>

<p>Was surprised this morning at a question, as "To
whom Tripoli belonged?" to the English or the Sultan
(of Constantinople). I find there is a vague notion
amongst our ghafalah that Tripoli is either really the
property of the English, or under the immediate protection
of England. "Just the same," say the people.
They prefer the late tyrant Bashaw, Asker Ali, to the
present Mehemet, because Asker Ali, they say, did not
fleece them so much or so plunder them of their money.
'Tis natural enough. One of the lower fellows had the
impudence to say, "The English Consul receives bribes
from Mehemet Pasha to let him remain in Tripoli."
These people are great gobemouches; they always report
the most incredible things. A trader said to me, "When
you get to Soudan you must marry two wives; this is
our custom." I replied, "I never do anything out of my
country, and apart from my countrymen, which I should
be ashamed to do at home in their presence." Some of
these Desert louts are very familiar and insolent, and
require sharp answers to keep them at a distance. I
must not forget to mention, the Rais put my passport
<i>en r&egrave;gle</i> for Soudan. A more monstrous piece of absurdity
could not be attempted against the virtue of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-391" id="V1-391"></a>[<a href="./images/1-391.png">391</a>]</span>
free and simple-minded children of The Desert. Such
documents are only fit for our elevated Christian civilization,
for countries like Naples, France, and Austria, the
hot-beds of spies and police. When I showed my passport
to the Touaricks, and explained to them what it
was for, they very indignantly (and properly so) spat
on it.</p>

<p><i>29th.</i>&mdash;Not a living creature was met with to-day.
Our camels found the "dry bones" of camels perished in
The Desert; they munched them with gusto, a piece of
cannibalism on the part of these melancholy creatures
which I was not prepared for. Dr. Oudney remarks,
"The latter (camels) are very fond of chewing dried
bones." In some parts of the routes, mostly where the
water-stations are distant, and where they drop from
exhaustion before reaching the wells, camels' bones lie in
such heaps as to suggest, the Vision of the Dry Bones of
Ezekiel.</p>

<p>We started with the rising sun and continued till four
o'clock <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> A strong S. and S.E. wind blew all day,
and very cold, parching my lips and mouth. This wind
would have a veritable burning simoon in the summer!
We traversed all day the plateau, now become an immeasurable
plain. It slightly undulates in parts, but I
think we continued to ascend. Some of the surface is
wholly naked, having neither herbage or stones scattered
about, being of a softish clayey soil, and printed in little
diamond squares, like the dry bottom of a small lake on
the sea-shore. This, I doubt not, is the action of the
rain, which falls at long intervals. Other parts presented
the usual black calcined stones, and sometimes pieces of
the common limestone and pebbles, but not very round.<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-392" id="V1-392"></a>[<a href="./images/1-392.png">392</a>]</span>
The track was in some places well-defined, in others the
earth so hard as not to admit of the impression of the
camel's foot. Passed by several tumuli of stones, said
by the people to mark the route, and called <i>&acirc;lam</i>&mdash;&#8238;&#1593;&#1604;&#1605;&#8236;&mdash;directors.
Passed also a conspicuous tomb of some
distinguished individual, who had died in the open
Desert. There was no writing or ornament, only a higher
heap of stones, and piled in the shape of an oblong
square. As soon as a traveller dies he is buried, if he
have companions; the body is never brought to the
neighbouring oases. My friend Haj-el-Besheer, to my
regret, has disappeared with the Touarick.</p>

<p>Nothing possibly could be more horrible and dreary,
exhibiting the very "palpable obscure," than our course
of to-day. As far as the eye can stretch on every side
is one vast, solitary, lifeless, treeless expanse of desert
earth! It is a&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Dreary [plain] forlorn and wild,</span>
<span class="i0">The seat of desolation."</span>
</div></div>

<p>A Derge Arab said to me this evening, "The English
will never come to Derge, wherever else they may go.
The climate will kill them; in three days you will die of
fever." The love of discussion, as well as their complaints
against the Turkish Government, follow our
people through The Desert. They are trying to make
me turn Mohammedan, as far as disputing goes, and I
have enough to do to get rid of their importunities.
Sometimes I get the conversation turned by telling them,
if I turn Mussulman I shall offend my Sultan. They
reply, "Oh! you can confess with your lips, that you
are a Christian, whilst you remain a Mussulman in your<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-393" id="V1-393"></a>[<a href="./images/1-393.png">393</a>]</span>
heart." One fellow got saucy, and said, turning up the
fire with a stick, "The Jews and Christians will have
this (fire) for ever." Threatening to report him to the
Rais of Ghadames, he exclaimed, "The dog Rais has
no rule in The Sahara." The other people made him hold
his tongue. Felt the cold last night but especially this
morning. It nips me up severely. Sleep in the clothes
I wear during the day, and have additional covering of
a thick rug and a cloak. We pitch no tents. Very
little water is now drunk. Our people seem to shun it
as mad dogs. As to the morning, no one drinks water
this time of the day. How different to the summer!
when a drink of water is sometimes reckoned a great
favour, an immense boon, a heaven's best gift.</p>

<p><i>30th.</i>&mdash;A fine morning; the dawn almost cloudless.
Not so yesterday, volumes of cloud on cloud inflamed
with purple stretched over all the east, not unlike an
English summer's dawn, but the colours more vivid. But
this was succeeded by the dreariest of days. In summer,
the Saharan dawn is usually cloudless, and offers no
beautiful variety of colours. The cloud of yesterday
was surcharged with wind, which we soon felt to our
annoyance. In The Desert the wind generally rises in
the morning and falls in the evening. We continued
our course over the vast plain all the morning, but at
midday it broke into wide shallow valleys, and in the
evening it was cut across by a large broad valley, or
wady, as the Moors called it, stretching east and west.
In this wady lies the well of <i>N&#259;th&#257;r</i> or <i>N&#259;j&#257;r</i>,
some spelling the name with the &#8238;&#1586;&#8236;&mdash;&#8238;&#1575;&#1604;&#1606;&#1586;&#1575;&#1585;&#8236;. Here we encamp.
We had come a very long weary day. Begin to feel
very sensibly the hardships of Desert travelling. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-394" id="V1-394"></a>[<a href="./images/1-394.png">394</a>]</span>
length of a day's journey depends upon whether water
is near or far off, and also upon there being fodder for
camels. Our Arabs are obliged to look out lest they
encamp upon an arid spot where the poor camel cannot
crop a single herb. Mostly in the beds&mdash;dry beds of
these wadys&mdash;there is some herbage and brushwood.
The well of Nathar is very deep, and cut through rock
as well as earth, but its water is extremely sweet and
delicious. We usually find the best water running
through rocky soil. <i>En route</i>, I observed no living
creature, save a grasshopper, which had managed to get
into existence amidst these herbless wilds. Think I also
saw an ant near the foot of the camel. A few flies still
follow our caravan, which we brought from Ghadames.
These witless things have wisdom enough not to remain
behind and perish in The Desert. Passed by two dead
camels, fast decomposing into bones. Road all small
stones sprinkled over an earthy soil, or altogether earth.
Mirage again seen, with similar phenomena. Small islets
in the midst of lakes, and white foam running on the
ground as on the sea-shore. Our course S. and S.E.</p>

<p><i>1st December.</i>&mdash;A fine mild morning, but intensely
cold during the past night. Here we took fresh water
enough for four days, the time required to arrive at the
next well. Started about 11 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, and continued only
three hours and a half, when we came to another wady,
where we stopped in order to let the camels have their
fill of the rich fodder with which the wady is covered.
The plateau is now apparently disappearing, for it is
broken into deep and broad valleys, from the sides of
which rise in groups, and at various distances, low ranges
of Saharan hills, and on one side, is a range very high,<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-395" id="V1-395"></a>[<a href="./images/1-395.png">395</a>]</span>
having very wild mountainous features. We have now
travelled nearly six days, and have not yet met with
fifty yards of sandy route. So much for the sandy
Desert! All is either earth, sometimes as hard-baked as
stone, or large blocks of stone, but chiefly very small
chips of stone covering the entire surface. Our Arabs
ask me, "Whether I prefer travelling by land or sea?"
They imagine Christians, when they travel, necessarily
travel by sea. They are also greatly astonished when I
tell them we have no Sahara in England, and cannot
credit the idea of a country being full of cultivated fields
and gardens. The rest of our ghafalah, consisting of
more than a third, is not yet come up, but Haj-el-Besheer
and the Touarick Ali have joined us again and
report them to be at the well of Nather.</p>

<p>Two or three birds were seen this morning about the
wells. They were excessively familiar, and knew instinctively
how to estimate the sight of a caravan for
the crumbs and grains it might leave behind. They
seemed also quite at home at the well. Still one would
think they were birds of passage, like ourselves, for there
are no trees or bushes for them to build in, and little to
eat. Saw also a single lizard. I believe lizards abound
in every part of The Sahara, but the cold now keeps
them in their holes.</p>

<p>Three or four of our party have left us, mounted on
maharees, for Ghat. They say they shall arrive in six
or seven days. They will soon see if banditti are before
us, and will return to let us know. Thought I should
escape the orthodox <i>body</i>-guard. But it seems not.
Where every person is obliged to accept of this guard,
<i>bon gr&eacute;, malgr&eacute;</i>, it seems I must submit. However, I shall<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-396" id="V1-396"></a>[<a href="./images/1-396.png">396</a>]</span>
do without their services if possible. I offended a Moor
by telling him that Christians do not require it, and have
not this guard: it is only "peculiar to Mussulmans." A
necessary part of the occupation of a ghafalah when it
reaches a well is collecting and cracking the vermin. The
camels are terrible things for straying. If they are surrounded
with immense patches of the most choice herbage,
even which is their delicium, they still keep on straying the
more over it miles and miles. As to our nagah, we are
obliged to tie her fore-feet, which prevents the camel
from getting at a very great distance from the encampment.
The camels are sly, unimpassioned, and deliberately
savage, one to another, more especially the
males. At times they go steadily, and even slowly,
behind one another, and turning the neck and head sideways,
deliberately bite one another's haunches most
ferociously. The drivers immediately separate them, for
the bite is dangerous to their health, and often attended
with serious mischief to the animal bitten. But I have
never yet seen a camel kick or attack a man. They invariably
grumble and growl, sometimes most piteously,
when they are being loaded, as if deprecating the heavy
burden about to be placed upon them, and appealing to
the mercy of their masters. The merchants pay 13&frac12;
Tunisian piastres per cantar for goods now conveyed
from Ghadames to Ghat. The Touaricks carry goods
cheaper, but they are now gone after the Sh&acirc;nbah. The
Arabs asked 25, but the Rais of Ghadames fixed it at
13&frac12;. A camel carries from 2 to 3&frac12; cantars<a name="FNa_1-62" id="FNa_1-62"></a><a href="#FoN_1-62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>. I confess
I was sorry to see these apparently so quiet and<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-397" id="V1-397"></a>[<a href="./images/1-397.png">397</a>]</span>
melancholy creatures ferocious to one another; but I
recollected that all animals, even doves, quarrel and
fight, and particularly males, where females are concerned.</p>

<p>To-day took out of my trunk Mr. Fletcher's note to
me, to read over, which I had received from Malta
during the time of my being in The Desert. The advice
to travellers which it contains in a very few words, is so
good, so excellent, that I shall take the liberty of transcribing
it here, for the benefit of all future tourists in
The Desert.</p>

<p>1st. "Keep a sharp look out about you, and pick up
information."</p>

<p>2nd. "Keep with Sheiks, Religionists, (he means I
suppose, Marabouts,) and Chieftains, for these are the
only people who can give you protection."</p>

<p>3rd. "Expose yourself to no unnecessary risks and
dangers."</p>

<p>4th. "Conciliate!"</p>

<p>Mr. Fletcher adds, "The white man is at the mercy
of every tenant of The Desert, and though we would,
one cannot be all things to all men." Nevertheless, I
do think, <i>poverty</i> is my great protection in travelling in
these countries. My fellow-travellers, up to the present
time, are civil and assist me. It is necessary to mention
here, I have neither compass nor thermometer, nor
measure of any kind, nor maps, nor watch, so that I'm
afraid my journal will sound ill to scientific ears. This
was very bad management. Still we shall see what a
man can do without the ordinary and most common
scientific instruments of travelling. I have, however,
an hour-glass, which embraces four hours in the time of<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-398" id="V1-398"></a>[<a href="./images/1-398.png">398</a>]</span>
emptying, and which I found useful in Ghadames, but
make no use of it <i>en route</i>. I consider the objects of
my tour <i>moral</i>, a random effort to maim, or kill, or
cripple the Monster Slavery, a small rough stone picked
up casually from the burnt and arid face of The Desert,
but with dauntless hand thrown at this Titanian fabric of
crime and wickedness. However, as my friend Mr.
Fletcher advises, it does not prevent me from "picking
up information," any how and everywhere, which I trust
the reader will have already perceived. As a person
who loses one sense acquires more intensity in others, so
I, having no artificial means for procuring information
with me, must do all by the ordinary senses of observation,
common to the civilized man and the savage.</p>

<p>The mirage was very abundant to-day, producing a
variety of splendid phenomena, "<i>Castelli in Spagna</i>,"
running streams, and silvery lakes, and a thousand
things of water, and air, and landscape, just types of those
pleasures and delights which we seek, and when grasping
them, they slip from between our fingers.</p>

<p>Whilst we were encamped, two hours before sun-set, we
were suddenly alarmed by the cries of banditti and
Sh&acirc;nbah, and all were called upon to arm. At the same
time people were sent off to bring up the camels which
were grazing and straying at a distance. I was amusing
myself with cooking the supper, and started up, not
knowing what to make of it; I couldn't however help
laughing at the queer predicament in which the supper
looked, and thought I had been making it for the Sh&acirc;nbah.
Running forward to see the cause of the alarm, I
saw in the south, dimly at a distance, a small caravan
approaching us. There were three or four camels, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-399" id="V1-399"></a>[<a href="./images/1-399.png">399</a>]</span>
several persons on foot. I then thought I must look
about for a weapon of some sort. A man gave me a
huge horse-pistol, and with this I sallied forth to take
part in the common defence. Seeing an Arab far in
advance, and alone, I went after him, who turned out to
be one of the Souafah, whose acquaintance I had already
made. This Arab certainly showed considerable bravery,
and took up a reconnoitring position on a rising ground,
looking with a steady and determined eye upon the approaching
caravan. He turned to me and said bluffly,
"It must be a Touarick ghafalah." Meanwhile, about
forty people all armed, assembled <i>p&ecirc;le-m&ecirc;le</i> on the opposite
side of the route, on a hill behind, uttering wild
cries, and throwing up their matchlocks into the air.
The cries now ceased, and was succeeded by a most
anxious silence, all waiting a closer observation. At
length, the experienced eye of our people discovered
what was considered a troop of bandits on foot, to be a
caravan of slaves. And immediately a number of the
people ran off violently to meet the slave-caravan, which
was escorted by our own Touaricks, the slaves being the
property of our people. Our surprise was the greater
when we found Haj-el-Besheer, and his companion the
Touarick, returning with the caravan, which had brought
letters for all the people. So the bandits turned out to
be our friends and neighbours; and so burst this bubble
of alarm. I observed two persons with long staffs
lagging behind, and imagined them old men labouring
along the route. What was my astonishment to find, as
they approached, these old men gradually transformed
into poor little children&mdash;child-slaves&mdash;crawling over the
ground, scarcely able to move. Oh, what a curse is<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-400" id="V1-400"></a>[<a href="./images/1-400.png">400</a>]</span>
slavery! how full of hard-heartedness and cruelty! As
soon as the poor slaves arrived, they set to work and
made a fire. Some of them were laden with wood when
they came up. The fire was their only protection from
the cold, the raw bitter cold of the night, for they were
nearly naked. I require as much as three ordinary great
coats, besides the usual clothing of the day, to keep me
warm in the night; these poor things, the chilly children
of the tropics, have only a rag to cover them, and a bit
of fire to warm them. I shall never forget the sparkling
eyes of delight of one of the poor little boys, as he sat
down and looked into the crackling glaring fire of desert
scrub. In the evening I noticed the amount of the food
which was given as the one daily meal to these famished
creatures, ten in number. Said usually eats more than
the whole of it for his supper. The food was barley-meal
mixed with water. The slaves were children and
youths, all males. They had been already fourteen days
<i>en route</i> from Ghat, and would be eight more before they
could reach Ghadames. By that time, like the last
slaves which arrived whilst I was there, they would be
simply "living skeletons." The misery is, these slaves
are conducted not by their masters, but slave-drivers, at
so much per head, and consequently the conductors feed
the slaves on as little as possible, to make the most of
their bargain with the owners. The slave-caravan, however,
brought us good news.</p>

<p>The Sh&acirc;nbah, after ravaging the Touarick districts,
had fled their own country, and taken refuge in the
Algerian territory&mdash;so escaping the vengeance of the
Touaricks. We have, therefore, no enemy <i>en route</i>,
thank God, except ourselves, and our own quarrels,<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-401" id="V1-401"></a>[<a href="./images/1-401.png">401</a>]</span>
which occur but seldom. The annual winter Soudan
caravan had not yet arrived in Ghat, but was expected
every day. It is worth mentioning here, as a remarkable
trait of good faith amongst the Moors and Arabs, that
they do not often seal their letters, but fold them up as
we do notes of trifling import. All the letters brought
to-day were unsealed, and did not require <i>Grahamizing</i>.
Haj-el-Besheer told me it was <i>haram</i> ("prohibited,") for
strangers to read these unsealed letters. My readers
will see that we are again obliged to go to the barbarians
of The Desert to learn the ordinary practices of good
faith and morality. How exceedingly rejoiced would be
the "<i>Haute Police</i>" of <i>civilized</i> Europe to have all
letters sent <i>un</i>-sealed through the Post Office! What a
pity these Mahometan barbarians are so trusting and
simple-minded! What a pity our boasted religion does
not teach us Christians the honesty of barbarians! We
wrote letters to Ghadames and Tripoli over the fire-light.
Afterwards my friend Haj-el-Besheer commenced a sing-song
repetition of a Marabout legend, which he continued
all the evening, speaking to no one; even whilst he was
eating he continued his rigmarole story to himself, the
people taking no notice of him. I was greatly amused at
this odd singing to one's self.</p>

<p><i>2nd.</i>&mdash;A very fine morning, and, as I anticipated, it
turned out very hot. Yet whilst the sun scorched my
face on one side, the cold wind from the east blanched
my cheek on the other. No living creature seen but a
few insects. Our people fell in with the skeleton of a
Touarick ass, and amused themselves with setting it up
upon its legs, as if in the pillory. I rallied them afterwards
as they were in a good humour, on their terror of<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-402" id="V1-402"></a>[<a href="./images/1-402.png">402</a>]</span>
banditti yesterday. They replied, "It was the number
of people on foot which alarmed us, banditti generally
go on foot with a few camels to carry provisions and
water." We started at sun-rise and encamped an hour
before sun-set, to have light enough to collect firewood,
and forage for the camels. The ground of our course
to-day was broken into broad and long valleys. In the
wady where we encamp is herbage for camels. I notice
as a thing most extraordinary, after seven days from
Ghadames, two small trees! the common Desert acacia.
Another phenomenon, I see two or three pretty blue
flowers! as I picked one up, I could not help exclaiming,
<i>Elhamdullah</i>, ("Praise to God!") for Arabic was growing
second-born to my tongue, and I began to think in
it. An Arab said to me, "Y&acirc;kob, if we had a reed
and were to make a melodious sound, those flowers, the
colour of heaven, would open and shut their mouths
(petals)." This fiction is extremely poetical. Felt unwell
this morning from eating or munching too many
dates; better this evening. All our people well, and no
accidents.</p>

<p><i>3rd.</i>&mdash;Rose at sun-rise and pursued our weary way
over broken ground, now broad valleys, now low hills.
Whilst exclaiming that the sandy desert was all "a
report," "a talk," "a fabrication of travellers who wished
to increase and vary the catalogue of Saharan hardships,"
at noon we came upon a range of sand-hills. These
increased on every side, and at length we cut right across
a group of them. Having left the plateau the mirage has
also disappeared, apparently the only species of desert
where it can be fairly developed. With the sand has
appeared a new kind of stone, of a light-blue slate<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-403" id="V1-403"></a>[<a href="./images/1-403.png">403</a>]</span>
colour, some of it of as firm a consistence as granite.
Its colour also sometimes varies to a beautiful light green.
The Desert itself only increases and varies in hideousness.
And yet in some places where sand is sprinkled
over the hardened earth, a little coarse herbage springs
up. Encamped at night. Cold all day. Felt unwell.
To-day and yesterday course mostly south.</p>

<p><i>4th.</i>&mdash;Sand-hills increase in number, and find ourselves
in the heart of a region of sand. At noon descended
the deepest wady we have yet encountered. On the big
blocks of rock below Arabic and Touarghee letters were
carved. The barbarians, as their civilized brethren, seek
in this way also a bastard immortality for their names.
Down in the valley we passed some human bones; the
skull was perfect. Who shall write the history of these
bones? Are they those of one who was murdered, or
who dropped from exhaustion in The Desert? These
bones scattered at the camel's feet made the march of
to-day still more melancholy. No herbage for camels or
wood for fire. Gave our nagah barley and dates. It
frequently happens, there is no wood <i>en route</i> (I mean
underwood or scrub), or at the place where we are
obliged to stop. This obliges us to carry it from places
where it abounds, as also a little herbage for the camels.
Pitched our camp amidst the sandy waste late at night.
Our route varied between S.W., S., and S.E., but around
some huge groups of sand-hills we were obliged to make
a painful circuit. Warmer to-day, and a little wind,
always from the east. No living creature met with!
No sound or voice heard! Felt better to-day.</p>

<p><i>5th.</i>&mdash;Rose with the sun, as it enflamed the sand-hills,
and made them like burnished heaps of metal. Marched<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-404" id="V1-404"></a>[<a href="./images/1-404.png">404</a>]</span>
three hours amidst the sand-hills. Very difficult route
for the camels, which frequently upset their loads in
mounting or descending the groups of hills. The Arabs
smooth the abrupt ascents, forming an inclined plane of
sand, and then, in the descents, pull back the camels,
swinging with all their might on the tails of the animals.
No herbage&mdash;no stone&mdash;no earthy ground&mdash;all, everything
one wide waste of sand, shining under the fervid
sun as bright as the light, dazzling and blinding the eyes.
But Milton's poetic eye, turning, or in "a fine frenzy
rolling" to the ends of the earth, subjecting all the
images and wonders of nature, of all climates and countries,
to the supporting of his majestic verse, glanced also
at these sands of the Lybian Desert&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Unnumbered as the sands</span>
<span class="i0">Of Barca or Cyrene's torrid soil."</span>
</div></div>

<p>El-A&iuml;shi, describing the sandy Sahara, says, "There
is neither tree, nor bush, nor herb. The eye sees only
clouds of sand, raised by continual winds, which by their
violence efface the marks of the caravan as fast as men
and animals imprint them with their feet. The aspect
of this immensity of sand reminds me of the words,
'Bless our Lord Mahomet as much as the sand is
extended,' and I understood now their full import."</p>

<p>But here in the centre of this wilderness of sand we
had an abundant proof of the goodness of a good God.
Whilst mourning over this horrible scene of monotonous
desolation, and wondering why such regions were created
in vain, we came upon <i>The Wells of Mislah</i>, where we
encamped for the day. These are not properly wells,
for the sand being removed in various places, about four<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-405" id="V1-405"></a>[<a href="./images/1-405.png">405</a>]</span>
or five feet below the surface, the water runs out. Indeed,
we were obliged to make our own wells. Each
party of the ghafalah dug a well for itself. Ghafalahs
are divided into so many parties, varying in size from
five men and twenty camels, to ten men and forty camels.
Three or four wells were dug out in this way. Some of
the places had been scooped out before. Water may be
found through all the valley of Mislah. A few dwarfish
palms are in the valley, but which don't bear fruit. The
camels, finding nothing else to eat, attacked voraciously
their branches. It is surprising the sand is not more
scattered over the wells and trees, for on the south-west
is a lofty sand-hill, deserving the name of a mountain,
almost overhanging the pits. Here is a sufficient proof,
at once, that The Desert has no sandy waves like the
Desert Ocean of waters, as poets and credulous or exaggerating
writers have been pleased to inform us. Were
this the case, the wells of Mislah would have been long
ago heaped up and over with pile upon pile of sand-hills,
and caravans would have abandoned for ever this line of
route. For we can hardly suppose that one sand-storm
would cover the pits of Mislah with a mountain pile of
sand, and the next sand-storm uncover them and lay
them bare to the amazed Saharan traveller. On the
contrary, the pits of Mislah and the stunted palms have
every appearance of having remained as they now are
for centuries. The hills are huge groups, some single
ones, glaring in sun above the rest, and others pyramidical.
The sand at times is also very firm to the
camel's tread. Shall I say a <i>terra firma</i> in loose shifting
sands? But for the water of Mislah it is extremely
brackish, nay salt. I had observed between the sand-<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-406" id="V1-406"></a>[<a href="./images/1-406.png">406</a>]</span>hills
small valleys, or bottoms, covered with, a whitish
substance which I now find salt. Both men and camels
are alike condemned to drink this water. I try it with
boiling and tea and find it worse, and cannot drink it,
so I'm obliged to beg of our people the remaining sweet
water of Nather, left in the skins. Our people confess
themselves, in summer when this water gets hot they
can scarcely drink it, being veritable brine. An European
travelling this route should always provide himself with
water enough at the well of Nather to last him from six
to eight days. My skin-bags have got out of order, and
I did not make inquiries of the people about this well.
At one well a traveller should always make inquiry about
the water of the next well. This is indispensable if an
European tourist would have water fit to drink. The
Mislah water is full of saline particles, and is purging
every body. The valley of Mislah, over which we are
encamped, is not more than twenty minutes' walking in
length, and half this in breadth. In many parts the
sand is encrusted with a beautiful white salt. One of
the Arabs of Souf said to me, "See, Y&acirc;kob, this is our
country, all Souf is like this." So it appears an oasis
may exist in a region of <i>shifting</i> (?) sands. Are these
the shifting sands which bury whole caravans beneath
their sandy billows, when lashed up by the Desert tempest<a name="FNa_1-63" id="FNa_1-63"></a><a href="#FoN_1-63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>?</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-407" id="V1-407"></a>[<a href="./images/1-407.png">407</a>]</span></p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill1-15.jpg"><img src="./images/ill1-15_th.jpg" alt="Region of Sands" title="Region of Sands" /></a></p>

<p>This reminds me of what Colonel Warrington told
me of some tourist, who describes himself as killing
a camel to procure the water from its stomach, when
within a couple days from Tripoli, and on a spot where
there was a splendid spring of never-failing water. I often
asked the Arabs, if they ever killed the camel to get the
water from its stomach? They replied, "They had often
heard of such things." A merchant of Ghadames made,
however, an apposite observation: "This is our sea, here
we travel as you in your sea, bringing our provisions and
water with us."</p>

<p>These pits are considered the half-way house or
station to Ghat. I'm told the route from Ghat to<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-408" id="V1-408"></a>[<a href="./images/1-408.png">408</a>]</span>
Aheer is much more easy and agreeable than this.
Trust I shall find it so if I go. Begin to feel this irksome,
and am in low spirits. People try to amuse me,
and I have received many little presents of date-cakes
and bazeen from them. Begin to relish this sort of food,
and The Desert air sharpens the appetite. Yesterday, a
slave of the ghafalah amused us with playing his rude bagpipe
through these weary wastes. We are not very merry.
There is very little conversation; we move on for hours
in the most unbroken silence, nothing being said or whispered,
no sound but the dull slow tread of the camel.
Sometimes an Arab strikes up one of his plaintive ditties,
and thinks of his green olive-clad mountain home in the
Atlas. Happily there is little or no quarrelling. I am
sure sixty people of all ages and tempers, were they
Europeans, travelling in this region of blank monotony,
oppressed with sombre reflections and without anything
to relieve the senses, would not manage things so
smoothly, or without quarrelling, and at times most
desperately. For we are a <i>bon&acirc; fide</i> moving city, and
at each well every body prepares to start afresh. Some
mend their torn clothes, others the broken gear of the
camels, others take out the raw materials from their bags
and work up a new supply of provisions. Others wash
and shave. Our Saharan travellers rarely wash themselves
except at the wells. Their religion requires of
them to wash their hands at their meals, but this they
evade by rubbing their hands with a little sand, a privilege,
however, Mahomet has only granted them when
they can find no water. We followed the tracks of the
few of our party who had preceded us. Here also the
footstep is rigidly observed as in the American wilder<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-409" id="V1-409"></a>[<a href="./images/1-409.png">409</a>]</span>ness,
and the people pretend to distinguish the foot-print
of the bandit on the sand from that of an honest man.
But one night of strong wind usually covers up the
track, and though the sand does not move in billows, it
flies about, first from one side and then the other, and
fills up the foot-prints of men and animals. There is no
doubt but it requires the most practised eye of the
camel-driver to find his way through these regions, and
yet, for my life, I could not see that the people experienced
any difficulty. They seemed as much at home
in this intricate waste of creation as in their own dark
zigzag streets of Ghadames.</p>

<p>As the sun goes down and night comes on, the sand-hills,
from shining white, look as dark and drear as earth-hills.
But how smooth is all! If they were hills of
blown glass they could not be more smooth. In the
sketch of Mislah will be seen a date-tree with part of its
branches depending, forming with the up-rising a curious
shape. The under foliage is dead and dried up, a fit
object in the desolate scene. Not a single living creature
about the wells. No bird is here. At Maseen and
Nather we had seen two or three small birds, hopping
about the wells, picking up the crumbs and scattered
grain of the passing caravan. Except the little vegetable
life, all else here is "a universe of death!"</p>

of the sublime mixed with the melancholy. Who cannot contemplate
without admiration masses of loose sand fully four hundred
feet high, ready to be tossed about by every breeze, and not shudder
with horror at the idea of the unfortunate traveller being entombed
in a moment by one of these fatal blasts, <i>which sometimes occur</i>?"
I agree with the Doctor about the sublime and melancholy mixed in
contemplating these regions of sand. But they are by no means
dangerous. No people that I heard of had been entombed under
these fatal blasts. I am almost sorry now that I did not pass
through the region of Mislah in a Saharan hurricane, and then I
should have known all.</p></div>

<p><i>6th.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Rose</span> at day-break but did not start until after
sun-rise. Continued through the sand. Scenery as yesterday,
hills heaped upon heap, group around group, and
sometimes a plain of sand, furrowed in pretty tesselated
squares like the sands of the sea-shore. I walked about
three hours to ease the nagah. The camels continued to
flounder in the sand, throwing over their necks their
heavy burdens. The ascents extremely difficult: people
employed in scooping an inclined path for the animals.
But, in the afternoon, about three, we saw through an
opening of the shining heaps, a blue and black waste of
contiguous desert. I could not help crying out for joy,
like a man at the prow who descries the port, after
having been buffeted about many a stormy day by contrary
winds and currents. Much fatigued with the walk<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-411" id="V1-411"></a>[<a href="./images/1-411.png">411</a>]</span>ing
over the sands, and sick with drinking the brackish
water of Mislah. Nothing <i>en route</i> to-day except four
crows, and a skeleton of a camel. This is the small
crow of The Sahara (&#8238;&#1594;&#1585;&#1575;&#1576; &#1575;&#1604;&#1589;&#1581;&#1585;&#1575;&#8236;). People pretend it
does not drink water. It may live on the flesh of the
few camels which drop down and die from exhaustion,
and on lizards. There are, however, no vultures and
ravenous birds of huge dimensions in this region of
Sahara. So that,</p>

<p class="figcenter">&#8238;&#1581;&#1610;&#1579;&#1605;&#1575; &#1610;&#1603;&#1608;&#1606; &#1575;&#1604;&#1580;&#1587;&#1583; &#1575;&#1610;&#1590;&#1575; &#1578;&#1580;&#1578;&#1605;&#1593; &#1575;&#1604;&#1606;&#1587;&#1608;&#1585;&#8236;</p>

<p>"Where the body is, there also collect the eagles," is
not applicable to this part of The Desert, although the
vulture, pouncing voraciously upon the dead man and
dying camel, is an appropriate feature in Saharan landscapes.
The large birds of prey do not find, as the
lion, water to drink in these regions. When we got fairly
upon the firm ground of Stony Sahara, I was refreshed
with the sight of seven small acacia trees. This seems to
be the only tree which will not surrender to the iron
sceptre of Saharan desolation, for it strikes its roots into
the sterility itself. A white butterfly also, to my amazement,
passed my camel's head! Where does the little
fluttering thing get its food in this region of desolation?</p>

<p>Another of the Souf Arabs said to me this morning,
"This sand is the country of the Souafah and the Sh&acirc;nbah."
If so, indeed, it would be a troublesome country
for a military expedition. "However," said a merchant,
"the maharee can pursue the Sh&acirc;nbah to the last heap
of their sands." Speaking of the Sh&acirc;nbah last evening
when we were in the midst of the sands, the Souafah
said:&mdash;"When the enemy will come, we shall cover ourselves
in the sand, and fire off our matchlocks. They<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-412" id="V1-412"></a>[<a href="./images/1-412.png">412</a>]</span>
will feel our bullets, and hear our report, and look about
and see no person. We shall be covered up in the
sand." This, the Souf Arab repeated several times, and
the Ghadamsee traders thought it astonishingly clever
and courageous. It is reported five hundred Touaricks
are soon to pursue the Sh&acirc;nbah into the Algerian territory.
It is said also, French Arabs will support the
Sh&acirc;nbah bandits against both Touaricks and Souafah.
Such is the silly talk of our caravan. Still the French have
got far south, and my Souafah companions acknowledge
that some of their districts pay tribute to the Algerian
authorities. This is something like <i>progress</i>, and we
ought not to deceive ourselves about their movements
southwards. Nothing is worse than self-deception. The
Romans struggled long before they made any sensible
progress in Africa, nay, several centuries. In fifteen
years the French have induced a whole line of Saharan
oases, more or less, to acknowledge their authority. And
the thing is done cleverly enough; they do not appoint
a local governor, or dispatch a single soldier, and yet
they manage to get some money from these distant
Saharan oases. However, this tribute must be very
trifling; and were all this line of Algerian oases to pay
their tribute regularly, it would be as a drop in the
bucket compared with the thousands of millions of francs
which have been spent, and will be spent in Algeria.
Such a colony as Algeria will not only not pay, but will
ruin the finances of a score of kingdoms as large as
France. The politics of our moving Saharan city are
mostly confined to the Pasha of Tripoli and the French in
Algeria. "When will the Pasha go, soon or late? Will
another come after him? Will he be better? Will he
fleece us as this despot, of all our money? Have the<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-413" id="V1-413"></a>[<a href="./images/1-413.png">413</a>]</span>
French many troops in Algeria? Have they more than
Muley Abd-Errahman? Could they conquer Morocco?
Why don't the English drive out the French from
Algeria? The Mussulmans of Algeria are now corrupted
by the money of the Christians. The Bey of
Tunis is the friend of the French. The Sultan of Constantinople,
Mehemet Ali, and the English are against
the Bey of Tunis and the French. Now, the Christians
have great power in the world, but they will soon be cut
off, when shall appear the new warrior of the faithful. Is
the Sultan of Stamboul strong? Has he more soldiers
than Moskou (Russia)? Have the French more soldiers
than the English? Is Mehemet Ali to have Tripoli
given him, and is he to march on to Tunis and against
the French?" &amp;c. All these, and a thousand other
questions and opinions similar, agitate the sage politicians
of our ghafalah: so true it is, that when we change the
heavens above, we do not change our thoughts on the
things below, which are left behind us.</p>

<p>My friend, Zale&acirc;, of Seenawan, did not come with us,
he having contracted for the building of the caravansary
of Emjessem, but his brother, a rough bold Arab, accompanied
us, who assured me to-day,&mdash;"That all the goods
of the ghafalah were the property of Christians and
Jews in Tripoli, and the Ghadamseeah merchants were
only their commission agents. These goods were to be
exchanged for Soudan merchandise, including slaves,
which latter, after being sold in Tripoli, the money of
their sale would be given up to the merchants under
European protection." This is a strong confirmation of
the opinion which I have expressed in my reports, "<i>That
the slave-traffic of Tripoli is supported by the money and</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-414" id="V1-414"></a>[<a href="./images/1-414.png">414</a>]</span>
<i>goods of Europeans</i>." My informant wished to know
and put the question:&mdash;"If I take you (the writer) to
Soudan, and bring you back safe, will you get me free
from paying taxes to the Pasha?" Another observed on
this,&mdash;"That's ridiculous, Y&acirc;kob; if you say that Mahomet
is the prophet of God, you can go safe to Soudan
without the protection of any body." I made answer
to this impertinence, that such language was not proper,
and if they continued to pester me with their religion, I
should report them to Rais Mustapha. This at once
silenced them.</p>

<p>Felt very sick this evening with drinking the water of
Mislah. It is purging all the people like genuine
Epsom.</p>

<p><i>7th.</i>&mdash;Started a little before sun-rise, when a clear
mist was spread like a mantle of gauze over old Sahara,
and lost the sight of the sand-hills in the course of the
morning. I joyfully bid them adieu, though it may be
very fine and Desert-like to talk and write of regions of
sand and sandy billows, furrowing the bosom of Sahara.
Winding about, but always making south. Wind now
from the west; the sky mostly overcast, but no signs of
rain. No living things <i>en route</i>, but a solitary crow, and
another solitary butterfly. The mirage again visible.
Very little herbage for the camels, and no wood for the
fire. On our right long ranges of low hills, dull and
drear outlines of The Desert. In some masses, the stone
and earth and chalk are thrown together in confusion, as
so many materials for creating a new world. Those
who traverse these Saharan desolations, cannot but receive
the impression, that old mother earth, slung on her
balance, and revolving on her axis, has performed eternal<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-415" id="V1-415"></a>[<a href="./images/1-415.png">415</a>]</span>
cycles of decay and reproduction. Time was, when these
heaps of desolation were fruitful fields of waving corn and
smiling meadows, and fair branching woods, meandered
about with running rills of silvery streams, where cattle
pastured lowing, and birds sang on the trees. Now,
heap upon heap, and pile upon pile of the ruins of
nature deform the dreadful landscape, one feature being
more hideous to look upon than the other: and the
whole is a mass of blank existence, having no apparent
object but to daunt and terrify the hapless wayfarer, who
with his faithful camel, slowly and mournfully winds his
weary way through the scene of wasteful destruction.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In
the sand, the pebbles are as bright and
smooth as those washed by the sea-spray, or chafed by a
running brook.</p>

<p>I have observed minutely the system of living amongst
our people, and really believe they have not enough to
eat. When they invite me to supper, and give me a
share of <i>bazeen</i>, I always require another supper on my
return, before going to bed. Besides, I always make a
slight repast in the morning, which they do not. Then I
eat dates and a piece of cake during the day's riding,
for we never stop during the day's march. They also
munch a few dates themselves. But, altogether, though
I'm a moderate eater, I believe I eat every day twice,
and sometimes thrice, as much as they eat. With respect
to clothing, I wear double the quantity they do, and,
nevertheless, feel cold at night. I may say with truth,
they are poorly fed and badly clothed. It is this
miserable system of living which makes them such lanky
bare-boned objects. I observe, also, they feel the fatigue
very much, as much as I myself, though unwell with<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-416" id="V1-416"></a>[<a href="./images/1-416.png">416</a>]</span>
drinking the water and serving a hard apprenticeship to
Desert-travelling.</p>

<p>I believe Europeans, in this season of the year, would
travel these Saharan wilds with less fatigue, and in far
superior style. I now walk two hours first thing every
morning. Most of the merchants do the same. Zale&acirc;
said to me, "Y&acirc;kob, we (pointing to three or four of his
people) are the only true men here, and understand affairs;
the rest are all good-for-nothing." Indeed, the Seenawanee
Arabs are generally very excellent camel-drivers, and
know the routes perfectly. We have with us a young
Touarick, who never covers his head winter or summer.
His hair grows long, unlike other Mohammedans, who
shave the head. This Targhee tells me he is never unwell.
We're encamped in a valley. As the sun sets, the
sky is encharged with clouds. But usually the wind
goes down a little after dark, and rises an hour or two after
day-break. Fortunately, this is not a month of winds, so
say the people.</p>

<p>As the camel moves slowly, but surely<a name="FNa_1-64" id="FNa_1-64"></a><a href="#FoN_1-64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>, on to Ghat, I
still revolve in mind the various routes of the interior.
I'm still as much at a loss as ever to determine which
route I shall take, and have only Providence for my
guide. There are various routes before me:&mdash;</p>

<p>1st.&mdash;To go to Soudan, <i>vi&acirc;</i> Aheer, and return with
the ghafalah of Ghadames, with which I proceed. This
is easy and simple, but does not offer much variety.</p>

<p>2nd.&mdash;To proceed to Soudan, <i>vi&acirc;</i> Aheer, as in the
first, and return <i>vi&acirc;</i> Bornou and Fezzan. This offers
both variety and security.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-417" id="V1-417"></a>[<a href="./images/1-417.png">417</a>]</span></p>
<p>3rd.&mdash;To proceed as before to Soudan, then Bornou,
then Darfour, Kordofan, Nubia, and Egypt. This is
various, new, and attended with danger, but I don't
know what extent of danger.</p>

<p>4th.&mdash;To proceed to Soudan, Kanou, and Noufee,
and then descend the Niger to the Bight of Benin.
This would be a fine journey, and perhaps not attended
with any very great difficulties.</p>

<p>5th.&mdash;To proceed to Soudan, as above, thence along
the upper banks of the Niger to Timbuctoo, and return
<i>vi&acirc;</i> Mogador in Morocco. This I believe the most
perilous of all the routes.</p>

<p>Any of these routes, however, could not fail to be
useful to commerce, geography, and discovery. Those
who take the route of descending the Niger to the ocean,
will avoid a three or four months' journey over The
Desert. Noufee, on the Niger, is only fifteen days from
Kanou, and seven to the Atlantic.</p>

<p>To-day passed several tumuli of stones, more than eight
feet high, evidently placed to direct the caravans over the
trackless portions of Sahara. I wonder what the people
of Europe will say when I tell them, that The Desert&mdash;pictured
in such frightful colours by the ancients, as
teeming with monsters and wild beasts, and every unearthly
and uncouth thing and being, not forgetting the
dragons, salamanders, vampyres, cockatrices, and fiery-flying
serpents, and as such believed in these our enlightened
days&mdash;is a very harmless place, its menagerie
being reduced to a few small crows, and now and then a
stray butterfly, and a few common house and cheese-and-bacon
and fruit flies! these poor little domestic everyday
creatures! Nay, there is not found here the wild<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-418" id="V1-418"></a>[<a href="./images/1-418.png">418</a>]</span>
ox, or the oudad, or the antelope, or ostrich, or the wild
boar, or any other animal which inhabit and mark the
Saharan regions near the north coast of Africa. It is,
indeed, impossible to conceive of a country so devoid of
living creatures as the route which we have traversed
these last twelve days. To this must be added, that now
is the favourable season for animals, and we should certainly
see them if there were any to be seen.</p>

<p>Of the four routes to Ghat, the next to us on the west,
is the shortest. People say the route which we are now
travelling is only frequented in this season, and mostly
by large caravans, or scarcely ever in the summer.</p>

<p><i>8th.</i>&mdash;Rose at day-break and started at sunrise: as
usual, the sky overcast and in an hour the wind got up
and blew a strong gale awhile from the south-east. To-day
Sahara looked unusually dark and drear; night as a
dread pall seemed to hang on the day and all visible
things&mdash;all life and animation was extinct but our lone,
solitary, melancholy caravan! We moved on in deep
and weary silence, not a noise, a cry, a murmur, the
grumbling of the camels was even hushed. Nothing
broke the horrid silence of The Desert. We wound
round long-long winding valleys&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Through many a dark and dreary vale</span>
<span class="i0">[We] pass'd, and many a region dolorous&mdash;"</span>
<span class="i4">"Where all life dies."</span>
</div></div>

<p>Most of the stone scattered <i>en route</i> was black shingle,
and all the region had a volcanic look. In one wady
through which we passed were found several stones
rounded into (shall I call them?) cannon-balls, scattered
about, and some were of prodigious size. They
were as round as if artificially made. There were also a<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-419" id="V1-419"></a>[<a href="./images/1-419.png">419</a>]</span>
great many halves, or half balls. Our people to divert
their minds from the gloom hanging around them dismounted
and amused themselves with these cannon-balls
of nature. Some would say that nature furnishes a type
of every thing in art. Our Touaricks assured us, "These
balls were made by the Jenoun, who on occasion of
quarrels, pelted one another with them. A traveller was
once killed with some of these balls during the night,
although a friend of the Jenoun." In a former period, I
imagine the action of water produced these specimens of
stony rotundity, for they were embedded in a deep wady.
On leaving this valley, I had also something else to
relieve me from the gloom of this day's march. On
mounting a small ridge of rock, abrupt, and full of sharp
stones, I was pitched off in a summerset style from the
back of the camel, and if I had not been caught in my
fall by a slave of the caravan, I should have fallen once
and for ever in this world; as it was, I felt stunned and
considerably hurt. This was my first and last fall from
the camel. I learnt caution at a great risk. The people
all crowded round to assist me, terribly frightened. My
thick woollen clothes saved my bones. I could not help
remarking the coincidence of being saved by a slave, for
the benefit of whom I had chiefly undertaken this
perilous journey. In general, the camel goes extremely
steady, it is only in mounting and descending that they
become unsteady, unwieldy, and dangerous. At other
times, you may sleep, eat and drink, read and write, on
the back of a camel. But as our days are short and
nights long, we require no sleep, and my eyes are too
bad for reading. Our people call camels by the Arabic
term <i>b&acirc;eer</i> (&#8238;&#1576;&#1593;&#1610;&#1585;&#8236;), the male camel is called <i>jemel</i> (&#8238;&#1580;&#1605;&#1604;&#8236;),<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-420" id="V1-420"></a>[<a href="./images/1-420.png">420</a>]</span>
and the female <i>nagah</i> (&#8238;&#1606;&#1575;&#1602;&#1607;&#8236;). As the she-camel is most
valuable for the sustenance of the tribes, the Touaricks
sometimes call the whole race of camels nagah. "We,"
say they, "have nothing but the <i>nagah</i> (she-camel),"
thereby meaning, our property alone consists in camels.
But the nagah is a great favourite with the Mussulmans
of all nations. Mahomet mounted a milk-white nagah,
when he ascended to paradise. The camels have all
public and private marks, the former for their country,
and the latter for their owner, and, strange enough, the
public mark of the Ghadames camels is the English
broad R. So when a camel is stolen, a man claims his
camel by his mark. The marking is done by branding
with a hot iron.</p>

<p>I can't help observing the habits of the camels, for our
continued marching affords us ample leisure. When these
melancholy creatures can find no other occupation <i>en route</i>,
or when there is nothing <i>en route</i>, or after a full
belly, they set to work, like men, and bite one another.
Often one of the camels falls, or throws its load, in a
regular encounter. The Moors and Arabs are bad
loaders of the camels, and there is always some camel
with its load falling off. In fact, the people do nothing
neat and well. Even the little gear required for these
animals is continually breaking and getting out of order.
People look to the immediate hour before them: not
excepting even the necessary articles of fodder and
water, and food for themselves, of which they often neglect
to take a sufficient supply. And yet if anything
could teach a man to be provident it is The Desert. If
this Saharan travelling were placed under the management
of Europeans, it would be infinitely more secure.<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-421" id="V1-421"></a>[<a href="./images/1-421.png">421</a>]</span>
Our camels are nearly all coast-camels, we shall soon
have to speak of the maharee. The Touarghee uses
quite a different style of address when he coaxes along
the camels; it is bolder and quicker in its intonations,
suited to the language of the Touaricks. A frequent
address of encouragement is, "<i>Bok, bok bok, bokka
bokka</i>." The Arabs usually command the movement of
the camels by "Tz&acirc;;" and when they are to stop, by
"Ush;" and, to kneel down, it is a prolonged pronunciation
of the guttural &#8238;&#1582;&#8236; or Kh-h-h. We may well
suppose, however, that the camels which travel this route
are expert linguists in the Touarghee and Arabic.</p>

<p>We continued all day till the last dull departing solar
ray of the west had left us. A long dark, dismal, dreary
day it has been. We encamped amidst two long ranges
of Saharan mountains as a shelter from the wind. Our
people detest the wind, they prefer burning heat to
wind. The mountains only deserve the name from their
frightfully gloomy aspect, not from their consistence or
magnitude, for in reality they are so much stony and
earthy rubbish shovelled up into long ridges. There is
nothing in shape or consistence of granite. I picked up
several pieces of petrified wood, but none of them pretty
or remarkable. So far as I can judge, there are no
minerals or rare stones to repay the researches of the
geologist in these regions of desolation. Noticed a
quantity of soft grey stone, as also of slate stone: observed
some lime-stone gradually acquiring the consistence
and colour of fine streaky marble.</p>

<p><i>9th.</i>&mdash;Rose as the day broke, and started with the
first rays of the sun. Continued through the same kind
of country, with an addition of a little sand here and<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-422" id="V1-422"></a>[<a href="./images/1-422.png">422</a>]</span>
there, for five hours, until we arrived at the well of
Nijberten, to our great joy, for it is a well of deliciously
sweet water. Around the well, I was pleased
with the sight of several dark bushes scattered upon
the small sand-hills. Anything in the shape of a tree
now gladdens the heart. I observe again, that vegetation
often springs out of the sand in preference to the hard
or even softer earth in The Sahara. A little sand, scattered
over the hard earth, and oftener solid rock, enables
vegetation to spring up, when the mould of Sahara produces
nothing. But there is little or no herbage for
camels. Give my nagah the barley which I provided for
my own use. People ridicule the choice of Rais Mustapha
in the purchase of the camel, and say she will
never carry me to Soudan.</p>

<p>I'm now writing the journal of yesterday. I can't
write every day. Sometimes several days elapse. Often
wonder how Denham could write his journal every day,
as he asserts. The wind is high and is scattering sand
in every direction. Certainly I require no supply of
sand when turning over my sheet wet with the ink.</p>

<p>Before we get to the water, we are obliged to scoop
out the sand as at Mislah. Many pits in Sahara are in
this predicament. But we are infinitely more repaid for
our pains, for we find most refreshing nectar-like water,
as good as the last was bad. I imagine I drank off a
full gallon at once. I was praying night and day for
this water, and was obliged to go from tent to tent,
begging a drop of the water which was left of Nather
well, until all the skins were empty of that water. Some
of the merchants kept a little in a small skin as a luxury.
But I must do our people justice, for seeing I could not<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-423" id="V1-423"></a>[<a href="./images/1-423.png">423</a>]</span>
drink the Mislah water, they gave me often their sweet
water and themselves drank the brackish. I must add,
I see no striking moral difference between the people of
this Desert caravan, and the people who fill an English
mail-coach or a French diligence. Mankind are morally
much the same everywhere. The last sixteen centuries
have added little or nothing to discovery and amendment
in morals, however orthodox we may all have become.
Our Christendom has been chiefly occupied in resisting
the worst features of the Mosaic economy as engrafted
by the corruptions of the Church on the Christian system.
The commission to Moses, "to extirpate the Canaanitish
tribes," has been the universal war-cry of the dominant
party in the Church to burn and empale heretics. There
are still many divinity professors who think it right
to kill heretics and infidels. The society of the nineteenth
century is still eaten up by the most rancorous
bigotry, and morality is proportionably at a low ebb.
Nevertheless, with all our present Desert hardships, we
are an easy journeying caravan; the patience of no one
is particularly tried, and there is no event to draw out
the real passions of the soul. We are now five days
from Ghat; to-morrow being the Ayed Kebir, we shall
make but a short day. Had a little private conversation
with a Souf Arab. There are some fifty families of Jews
in Souf, occupied in commerce. Speaking of the eternal
quarrel of the Sh&acirc;nbah and Souafah, I found him a
strong partisan of the Sh&acirc;nbah. "Fine fellows are the
Sh&acirc;nbah, like us the Souafah; one Sh&acirc;nbah would kill
five Touaricks," he exclaimed. Souf is a rich country.
This Souf Arab has thirty fine dughla date-trees, one of
finest species. Riches are estimated by the number of<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-424" id="V1-424"></a>[<a href="./images/1-424.png">424</a>]</span>
date-trees. He has two brothers now returning from
Soudan, bringing slaves and elephants' teeth for the
markets of Algeria.</p>

<p>The notorious Mohammed Sagheer, who slaughtered
thirty Frenchmen in cold blood at Biscara, is now at
Tozer, in Tunis. This flight of fugitives will continue as
long as France is in North Africa. It is inevitable.
When a political refugee is quiet his person should be
held sacred; and it was very dastardly on the part of
the French to demand to have this Arab Sheikh given
up. But the French mind is incapable of comprehending
what is a political asylum, or even what is constitutional
freedom. Local politics still stick close to our
ghafalah, and the people have such faith in my power
and influence, that they really believe I could, if I would,
get Ghadames freed from paying tribute to the Porte.
An Arab of Derge said, "If you return from Soudan,
and speak to the English Consul and English Sultan,
you will then serve us in Derge and Ghadames, but if
you don't come back we are all lost." The British Consul
of Tripoli might, indeed, do something for these oppressed
people, and save the Saharan commerce from impending
ruin. I quiet the people by telling them, (and which is
the fact,) I have repeatedly written to the English Consul
of Tripoli about their affairs, and to obtain some mitigation
of the oppression of their Government.</p>

<p>The bushes springing out of the sand are but a couple
of feet high, and their dark foliage is covered with
crystallized salt. They are a stinted species of acacia.
Nijberten is the first Touarghee name <i>en route</i>, and now
we are fairly in the Ghat territory. On our right, a
day's journey over some ranges of hills, are tents and<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-425" id="V1-425"></a>[<a href="./images/1-425.png">425</a>]</span>
flocks and inhabited districts. Passed several tumuli
of stones raised in the shape of graves. To-day the
stone had a better appearance, a good deal of grey and
red marble, and some isolated blocks of granite. No
birds, insects, or animals. Course south.</p>

<p><i>10th.</i>&mdash;Strong wind all day, and cold. The Ayed
Kebir. But our travellers only prayed a little longer in
the morning. Travellers are exempt from the ordinary
religious ceremonies and festivals. This feast is usually
kept up three days. A camel knocked up to-day, and
unloaded this morning. After two hours and half, passed
on the right the well of <i>T&#259;b&#259;bothteen</i>. People say its
water is still sweeter than that of Nijberten. Indeed,
we shall find the Ghat water to be usually sweet and
delicious. Scenery as usual, broken in valleys, hills, and
high ground. Some of the hills, covered partly with
sand, looked very pretty at a distance, shrouded as if in
a sheet of snow, and dazzling in the sun-beams. Encamped
early in the afternoon. The knocked-up camel
difficult to be got on. A Divan of camel-drivers was held,
and the question discussed, "Whether the camel should
be killed?" It was decided that it should be doctored
and left to graze until a Targhee was sent from Ghat for
it. A most piteous sight it was to look upon the poor
camel, prostrate and moaning, as if pleading the excuse
of its malady for not moving on. I could not stop to
look at the wretched animal. Nevertheless, I returned
again, and found the camel tied down, with its mouth
pulled open, and its jaws lashed back with cords, to
prevent the poor creature from groaning too loud. The
hot iron was being applied to the shoulder, where there
were some festering or dislocation; meanwhile, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-426" id="V1-426"></a>[<a href="./images/1-426.png">426</a>]</span>
creature groaned in dreadful but silent agonies. At
length, this doctoring finished, it was left to graze; but
being actually nearly burnt to death, it could not get up,
and was killed during the night, <i>to prevent it from dying</i>,
in order that our orthodox people might eat the flesh
like good Mussulmans.</p>

<p>Rais Mustapha amused me by telling how that the
Arabs watched the signs of immediate death, and just
stuck the camel in the last agony of dissolution, in order
that they might eat the flesh with an orthodox conscience.
Camels are killed differently from other animals. Sheep
and bullocks and fowls have their throats cut from side
to side, with "hideous gash," for they are the most slashing
throat-cutters; camels, on the contrary, are stuck in
the throat at the bottom of the neck, and the top of the
chest-bones. Next morning (<i>11th</i>), was held a Divan of
the whole ghafalah to decide upon the value of the
slaughtered camel, for the owner was in Ghadames. Its
worth was estimated at four dollars. I purchased a quarter
of a dollar's worth. The camel was young, but the meat
not very good. Our people soon devoured the meat.</p>

<p><i>11th.</i>&mdash;Rose early, but did not start till near noon, to
give the camels more rest. Old Sahara looks absolutely
pretty with the dark shrubs bespotting and besprinkling
his white shining sand-hills. The heavens are strewn
with soft flaky light clouds; the blue above is clear and
profound, and what other colours there are, look fresh and
fair. Our people catch the lighter and more exhilarating
influence, and are more talkative to-day. Descending to
grosser matters, they are joking about how much of the
camel's meat they are to swallow for supper. A part of
the ghafalah left us, as the main body would not start<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-427" id="V1-427"></a>[<a href="./images/1-427.png">427</a>]</span>
early, thinking to arrive a couple of days before us in
Ghat. I loaded and wished to go on with them, despising
my friend Fletcher's advice. They insisted I
should not accompany them, but come on with the larger
body of people. I was obliged to return, and it happened
for the best. This was a short day's march, but
wrote no journal. The advanced party excused themselves
for not letting me go with them, by saying, "We
are going amongst the Touaricks our friends for a few
days, and you will arrive first." I mentioned this to our
party, who say, "<i>They're liars.</i> Are you so foolish,
Y&acirc;kob, as to believe every thing a <i>Mussulman</i> tells
you?"</p>

<p><i>12th.</i>&mdash;Rose and started with the earliest rays of the
Saharan sun. Scenery as usual; but the ranges of
Saharan hills assuming a more battlemental shape, and
darker, blacker colour. Fast approaching the inhabited
districts; saw the traces of a route to Fezzan, on which
the foot-prints of sheep were visible. Saw some inhabited
mountains at a considerable distance, but no
peculiar feelings started in the mind, and I grow weary
of the journey. A dull drear and long day. Overtook
the advanced portion of our ghafalah, and had the
laugh at them. We asked them, whether they had seen
their good friends the Touaricks? whether they had
brought us fresh eggs, milk, and a whole sheep? We, of
course, begging our portion of the rich spoil. The
people now told me to place my tent within the circle of
the encampment, as we were getting near the inhabited
districts. I usually encamped at a short distance from
the centre of confusion in the ghafalah, and found it<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-428" id="V1-428"></a>[<a href="./images/1-428.png">428</a>]</span>
more quiet. As to fear, I had none, and slept more
soundly in the open Desert than in any part of the
world where I had travelled before.</p>

<p><i>13th.</i>&mdash;Rose at day-break, and, after a few hours'
riding, came in full view of the Touarick camel-grazing
country. We descended into a beautiful plain. After
such Desert, how lovely it was! the plain of the Paradise
of Sahara! This plain afforded many a taste of freshest
herbage for the camels, almost approaching to English
grass. They cropped it with rapacious greediness. Every
person's eyes sparkled with delight at seeing the famished
camels devour the herbage. We stopped half an hour to
let them graze. Here were butterflies in quantities
fluttering about, in dress of silver white, and gorgeous
hues of rubies, and labouring <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'bettles'">beetles</ins> and industrious
ants covering the small turf-hills, all which were to us
"signs of life," and living in the world. We had already
seen, before entering the fair plain, a small flight of
larks, and now we feasted our eyes on a few swallows
skimming this "flowery mead," for here and there were
pretty blue and red and yellow wild flowers. A moment
I forgot being in The Desert. The abundance of the
herbage arises from there having recently fallen copious
showers of rain&mdash;quite unusual in this thirsty country.
But our route is the worst and most desolate of all the
routes from Ghadames to Ghat. The other parallel
routes always afford more herbage, besides having some
inhabited tracts, with flocks of sheep and herds of
camels feeding. Indeed, with the exception of a few
people at the well of <i>Tadoghseen</i>, which we shall soon
mention, we found no inhabitants in this the most<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-429" id="V1-429"></a>[<a href="./images/1-429.png">429</a>]</span>
easterly route. Whilst passing through the plain I
espied a little black something moving about. In getting
up to it, to my astonishment it was a little child stark
naked! Our people were as much amazed as myself. I
thought within myself, if this be the way in which the
Touaricks bring up their children, exposed to cold and
heat, rain and wind, in such terrible plight in open
desert! no wonder then they can bear all the hardship
of The Sahara, as we a spring-day in Europe. It is impossible
for an European to contend with a nature like
that of the Touarick; we can never expect to adopt
their habits of Saharan travelling. The little wretched
urchin had been left by some of the shepherds, for
camels, goats, and donkeys were feeding about. The
child was very merry, but not old enough to speak
much. Our people gave the boy a piece of bread, which
he put at once to his mouth, and grinned "a thank you."
From the plain rises a huge block of rock in the shape of
a sugar-loaf, a frequent form of blocks of rock in this
desert. As we neared the well, I was greatly rejoiced at
the arrival of two slaves, one of which had been dispatched
by the Sheikh Jabour from Ghat, to tell me, "I
was to come with all confidence to Ghat, to fear nothing;
no Touarghee should say an untoward word to me." I
augured well of all things on the receipt of such news.
Our people were as pleased as myself on the arrival of
Jabour's slave. They called out to me to take the handkerchief
from off my face, to let the messenger see "the
face of a Christian."</p>

<p>After riding further, three or four Touaricks showed
themselves. I saluted them. They asked our people
what I said, and did not seem very friendly. I began<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-430" id="V1-430"></a>[<a href="./images/1-430.png">430</a>]</span>
to have suspicions<a name="FNa_1-65" id="FNa_1-65"></a><a href="#FoN_1-65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>. The advanced portion of the ghafalah
had disposed of their camels and baggage before I
got up to the well. Said and myself went up amongst
the people encamping, but, looking on my left about
fifty yards' distant, I saw a group of people and a quarrel
going on between our people, four or five Touaricks,
and two slaves. Our people were violently pulling a
slave one way, and Ouweek, a Touarghee chief, tearing
him as savagely the other way. At length the slave,
struggling stoutly, got free, and went further off to a
horse. Ouweek thought the slave intended to mount
the horse and ride off to Ghat; so the chief followed the
slave and again seized hold of him, and unsheathing his
sword, began beating him with its sides. The Ghadamsee
people and Arabs again interfered and rescued the
slave. In the meanwhile Haj Mafoul Zule&acirc; passed me,
and said, "Go up, go up." I replied, "Why? I shall
stop here, where I am." He answered something; but,
being hard of hearing, I could not catch what he said.
I determined not to move. Afterwards, thinking that
Zule&acirc; wished me not to be mixed up with the quarrel, I
went further on towards Ghat. I imagined the slave
had been overriding his master's horse, and was being
beaten for that. After staying some time up the road,
I returned to my camel, tired of waiting, and sat down,
telling Said to unpack. But it seems Said had heard
something which I had not, and said, "Not yet, not
yet." I insisted upon his unloading the camel, and took
out some dates and biscuits, and lay myself down to eat<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-431" id="V1-431"></a>[<a href="./images/1-431.png">431</a>]</span>
them. The scuffle and uproar was now going on about
a hundred yards from me, and I saw the sword of Ouweek
flourishing and flashing about. This was succeeded by a
calm, and a whole circle of people squatted down around
Ouweek. Meanwhile, the three followers of the Sheikh
went a short distance off, spread their heiks upon the
ground with great and solemn parade, and performed the
afternoon prayer, as if about to sanctify some impending
act of their Sheikh. I watched them anxiously. When
I had waited half an hour or so, several of our people,
with Zule&acirc;, returned, and not a little surprised me by
making to me the following announcement:&mdash;"Ouweek,
the Touarghee Sheikh of this district, wants to kill you,
because you are a Christian and an infidel. He has
just been beating one of the slaves for going to meet
you, accompanying the messenger of Ghat. He wished
you to come up to him, that he might dispatch you at
once." To say the truth, I had such confidence in the
Touaricks of Ghat, and had been so confirmed in my
confidence by the arrival of the messenger from Ghat,
that I could not believe this speech of our people, and
was disposed to think it a joke. I was perfectly cool,
and myself. But as they most seriously reiterated this
story, and let out a hint, or I gave the hint, I'm sure I
now forget in the confusion, that perhaps the business
could be compromised for money, I said to the spokesman,
Zule&acirc;, "Oh! for God's sake, go, go; yes, yes, make
a bargain." I noticed poor Said at the time, who was
staring at me full in the face, to see, it would appear,
how I was affected by this most unexpected incident.
After a great deal of squabbling and bargaining, in a
true mercantile style, it was finally arranged. Ouweek<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-432" id="V1-432"></a>[<a href="./images/1-432.png">432</a>]</span>
first fiercely demanded one thousand dollars! Hereupon
all the people cried out that I had no money. The
<i>quasi</i>-bandit, nothing receding, "Why, the Christian's
mattress is full of money," pointing to it still on the
camel, for he was very near me, although I could not
distinguish his features. The Touaricks who had come
to see me before I arrived at the well, observed, "He
has money on his coat, it is covered with money,"
alluding to the buttons. All our people, again, swore
solemnly I had no money but paper, which I should
change on my arrival at Ghat. The bandit, drawing in
his horns, "Well, the Christian has a nagah." "No,"
said the people, "the camel belongs to us; he hires it."
The bandit, giving way, "Well, the Christian has a
slave, there he is," pointing to Said, "I shall have the
slave." "No, no," cried the people, "the English have
no slaves. Said is a free slave." The bandit, now fairly
worsted, full of rage, exclaimed, "What are you going
to do with me, am I not to kill this infidel, who has
dared to come to my country without my permission<a name="FNa_1-66" id="FNa_1-66"></a><a href="#FoN_1-66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>?"
Hereat, the messenger from Ghat, Jabour's slave, of
whom the bandit was afraid, and dared not lay a hand
upon, interposed, and, assuming an air of defiance, said,
"I am come from my Sultan, Jabour; if you kill the
Christian, you must kill me first. The order of my Sultan
is, No man is to say a word to the Christian." Our
people now took courage from this noble conduct of the
slave, declaring, "If Y&acirc;kob is beaten, we will all be<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-433" id="V1-433"></a>[<a href="./images/1-433.png">433</a>]</span>
beat first; if Y&acirc;kob is to be killed, we will be killed likewise."
Ouweek now saw he must come down in his pretensions.
The bargain was struck, after infinite wrangling, for
a houlee and a jibbah, of the value of four dollars<a name="FNa_1-67" id="FNa_1-67"></a><a href="#FoN_1-67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a><ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: removed superfluous quotation mark">!</ins>
I did not, therefore, "sell for much," and Christians at four
dollars per head in The Desert must be considered very
cheap. It is said, every man has his price; I had not
the honour of fixing my price. This was done for me,
and I ratified the bargain. I made a present of a turban
to the brave messenger, whom the people assured me
acted a most noble part. It is strange that this is the
second time I have been preserved from something like a
catastrophe by the interposition of a slave. Did Providence
intend this as any sign of approbation of my anti-slavery
labours? We were all uneasy. Everybody had
to supply something; and it was hinted, that I ought to
send them supper. Our people did this, and would not
allow me, saying, that I lived with them and had no
provisions of my own. I was indignant at the conduct
of the Souf Arabs, who cowered down before the Touaricks,
and belied all their previous pretensions to courage
and intrepidity. Even a Seenawan Arab was frightened
at my coming near his tent, in dread of another quarrel
or attack during the night. All our people more or less
were alarmed and agitated, although we numbered sixty
in the presence of five Touaricks! I thought in myself,
What arrant cowards you are! To cover their cowardice
they pretended the Sheikh had hundreds of people not<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-434" id="V1-434"></a>[<a href="./images/1-434.png">434</a>]</span>
far off. Zale&acirc;, and his Arabs, certainly behaved the best.
Zale&acirc;, in fact, was now the only man of the caravan.
He told me afterwards, the Ghadamsee people had proposed
to him, that I should run away on to Ghat, but
he would not sanction such pusillanimity. I confess,
however, when the people described to me the character
of Ouweek, I myself felt considerable alarm. During
the succeeding night, I slept scarcely a wink. I made
the messenger of Jabour sleep close by my mattress, and
unsheathing Said's old rusty sword, laid it beside me,
determining "to die game," or put a good face upon the
matter. At any rate, I thought an Englishman could not,
however he might trust the good faith of these people,
die like an unresisting coward. Ouweek, like a true
politician, feasted the messenger dispatched from Ghat to
me nearly all night, and told him to report on his return
to Ghat:&mdash;"The Christian wished to give Ouweek a
handsome present, but the Ghadamsee people, who are
sorry dogs, would not let the Christian act from the
impulse of his heart. So Ouweek quarrelled with the
people of the caravan." The Sheikh and his followers
kept up a roasting fire all night, a stone's throw from my
encampment. The bandit was merry at the expense of
the alarms of me and our people, telling my messenger,
"These Ghadamseeah are all dogs, but the Christian is
no dog, for when I threatened to cut his throat, he sat
down quietly and ate dates and biscuits." The bandit
gave me more credit than I can take to myself, for, at
the time of munching the biscuits, I was not aware of his
violent attempt at levying black mail. There can, however,
be no question of the bad character of this Sheikh.
He has murdered several people, and, not long ago,<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-435" id="V1-435"></a>[<a href="./images/1-435.png">435</a>]</span>
killed a rich Marabout, going on a pilgrimage to Mecca,
plundering him of a great deal of property. He is therefore
no pleasant customer for a Christian to meet with on
the highways of The Sahara, whom he would decapitate
with less scruple of conscience than a Leadenhall poulterer
would cut off a goose's head. He has many people,
though a second-rate chief, and is allied by blood to the
reigning family of Shafou. Though a little insignificant
man, he possesses undaunted courage, and has signalized
himself in the wars against the Sh&acirc;nbah. He walks
lame with a wound he has received in battle. He is
generally dreaded in the open country, except by the
merchants, who are personally acquainted with him, to
whom he behaves as a very jolly fellow.</p>

<p><i>14th.</i>&mdash;All our people rose early, and got off as
quickly as possible. We could not breathe freely until
we were out of the clutches of Ouweek. Some of them,
however, paid a farewell visit to the Sheikh, who
received them very graciously, as politely as any Spanish
bandit, and sent this message to me:&mdash;"Y&acirc;kob, go in
<i>amen</i> (peace or security) to Ghat, fear nothing from
any one, for you are under my protection." Our people
encouraged me along. The Souf Arab, who was so
cowardly, said:&mdash;"Why didn't you say, 'Mahomet is
the prophet of God,' then you would have had to pay
no money." I called him a fool, and asked him, if all
the people didn't pay something as well as myself? This
stopped his mouth. Zale&acirc; fully agreed with me, as did
all our people, that if Ouweek had simply asked for a
present, he would have got more from me. I certainly
should have given him at once half a dozen dollars if he
had shown himself friendly, and welcomed me to his dis<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-436" id="V1-436"></a>[<a href="./images/1-436.png">436</a>]</span>trict
as a friendly stranger. It appears he refused
money, and even the camel, which the people in the
<i>imbroglio</i> said he might, if he choose, take; he took the
woollens, because he knew they would not be made a
question of restitution by the Sheikhs and Sultan. He
was clearly entitled to receive something from me, by the
usage of ages, commonly called "safety-money," but not
to demand it at the point of his broad-sword. This was
his great offence in the eyes of all his friends and the
authorities of Ghat.</p>

<p>I did not see the well, but the water of Tadoghseen is
extremely sweet and palatable. I should have paid my
homage to this well, as I had done to all the sources of
water in The Desert, had not Ouweek taken up his
quarters near it, and I was not anxious to disturb or
excite the curiosity of the bandit by a personal interview.
One of his followers came to see me off in the
morning, a tall attenuated black shape of a man.</p>

<p>We are now fairly in "the region of the Genii," the
land of mystery and disembodied spirits; and the whole
country is intersected and bounded on every side with
the battlemental ranges of black, gloomy, and fantastically-shaped
mountains, distinguishing the country of the
Ghat Touaricks, where their friends and confederates,
the Jenoun or Genii, dwell with them in the most harmonious
friendship. Here our people say,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Millions of spiritual creatures walk the earth</span>
<span class="ihalf">Unseen, both when we wake and when we sleep."</span>
</div></div>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill1-16.jpg"><img src="./images/ill1-16_th.jpg" alt="Rocking Rock" title="Rocking Rock" /></a></p>

<p>There exists a compact between the Genii and Touaricks
to this effect, a species of <i>Magna Charta</i>, and not
selling themselves to the Saharan devils:&mdash;"The<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-437" id="V1-437"></a>[<a href="./images/1-437.png">437</a>]</span>
Touarick fathers solemnly vowed, alone of mortals,
eternal friendship to the Genii, they would never molest
them in the various palaces which they (the Genii) had
built in their (the Touarick) country, nor use any means
either through Mahomet, or the Holy Koran, to injure
them or dislodge them from the black turret-shaped hills:
and for this devotion on their part, the Genii promised
to afford them (the Touaricks) protection at all times
against their enemies, more particularly during the night,
giving them vision and tact to <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'suprise'">surprise</ins> their enemy
during the dread hour of darkness." So the Touaricks
are reckoned very devils at night, and usually attack
their enemy at this time, and hack him to pieces with
their broadswords. Poor Major Laing was surprised
by a Touarghee chief in this way, two of his servants
were killed, and himself wounded, or cut and hacked in
some thirty places. The air of the region of Genii and
Touaricks we now breathed, but found it as free as that
of any part of The Sahara. Our people did not think
so, and they pointed out to me with a shuddering awe
all the mysterious objects. First and foremost, standing
out from the lower and more modest abodes of the
Genii, like a huge castle, such as the Titans might have
built when they scaled the walls of heaven, was the
<i>Kesar Genoun</i>, (&#8238;&#1602;&#1589;&#1585; &#1580;&#1606;&#1608;&#1606;&#8236;) "Palace of demons," <i>par
excellence</i>. This was the hall of council where the Genii
meet from thousands of miles round, and debate upon
their affairs of State. It is also the Jem&acirc; or Mosque,
where they meet on a Friday to pray to Allah, for they
also worship Allah, though not properly. These lower
and less destructive grades of Demonii "believe and
tremble." This is also the mint where the Genii keep<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-438" id="V1-438"></a>[<a href="./images/1-438.png">438</a>]</span>
their bullion. The entire caverns of this monstrous
block of rock are full of gold and silver, and diamonds,
and all precious jewels<a name="FNa_1-68" id="FNa_1-68"></a><a href="#FoN_1-68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>. A more <i>mortal</i> and sublunary
mystery was now pointed out to me. This was a small
block of rock about fifty feet high, of the shape of the
accompanying drawing; the lower or under part where
it comes in contact with the ground, being so exceedingly
small as not to be visible. Here was the dreadful spot
on which several people were murdered, and amongst the
rest a wealthy Marabout, but a saint of great sanctity.
The murderer (of what country it is not said), was so
ashamed and horrified at his own deed of blood, that
when he had committed it he begged the Genii to cover
up their bodies from his sight, for he had not courage to<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-439" id="V1-439"></a>[<a href="./images/1-439.png">439</a>]</span>
bury them. The Genii listened to his request, detached
this piece of rock from their great palace, where it has
rested, occasionally <i>rocking</i><a name="FNa_1-69" id="FNa_1-69"></a><a href="#FoN_1-69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>, say the people, to this day&mdash;a
memento against murder and crime! For this
service the murderer begged the Genii to accept of
some of the spoil, but they refused to accept of gold
tainted with blood; and, on the contrary, the avenging
spirits of justice pelted him with pieces of rock till he
died. He was fairly stoned to death, and his bruised
and broken carcase was left unburied, a horror to all
passers-by! We see the Genii are a moral people, and
in general the Mussulmans of The Sahara speak of them
as a good sort of folks, not unlike Puck and his merry<span class='pagenum'><a name="V1-440" id="V1-440"></a>[<a href="./images/1-440.png">440</a>]</span>
crew, only playing occasionally mischievous pranks upon
silly inconsiderate mortals.</p>

<p>Beyond the Kesar Jenoun stretches away north and
south the long range of black basaltic mountains, called
by our people Wareerat, but I am not sure if this be the
Touarick name. This ridge forms the boundaries of the
Tibboo and Touarick country, for it stretches as far or
farther south than the Tibboos, some fifteen or twenty
days' journey. From the town of Ghat to the base of
this range is half a day, eastward, although the range
looks, by the ordinary delusion of Desert optics, to be
close upon the town.</p>

noted and visited by all classes of travellers. Among the truly
romantic coast-scenery of Cornwall, at the south-west angle of the
county, are the celebrated Logan, or <i>rocking-stone</i>, and the lofty
granite rocks called <i>Tiergh Castle</i>. Here is a reef of rocks jutting
into the sea, on the summit of one of which is a large single mass
of stone, weighing about sixty tons, resting on a sort of pivot, so
near the centre that the whole block may be easily made to oscillate
or <i>log</i>, to and fro. This <i>logging</i> stone has created astonishment
amongst the illiterate, and given rise to many fabulous stories:
whilst others have imagined it was placed here by the Druids, to
overawe and terrify the vulgar.

Geologists, however, says Dr. Paris, readily discover, that the only
chisel ever employed has been the tooth of time&mdash;the only artists
engaged, the elements. Some years ago, the upper, or logging-stone,
was thrown from its equilibrium by the bodily exertions of some
sailors; but a general cry of indignation having been raised against
this wanton act, it was shortly afterwards reinstated in nearly its
original position by the perpetrators of the mischief, who, while
thus making honourable amends for their former folly, evinced great
ingenuity and skilfulness.&mdash;<i>Fisher's Views in Devonshire and Cornwall.</i></p></div></div>
